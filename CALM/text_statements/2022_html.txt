Table of Contents 19 existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of May 28, 2022, we had $44.0 million of goodwill. While we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired, future goodwill impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period and our net worth. Events beyond our control such as pandemics, extreme weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business. Pandemics such as COVID-19, or similar disease outbreaks in the future, may depress demand for shell eggs due to quarantines or restrictions on public interactions that would limit the ability of consumers to purchase shell eggs. Pandemics, or similar disease outbreaks in the future, may disrupt our supply chain and operations at our facilities. If a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforce of our suppliers or transportation providers, is unable to work because of illness or government restrictions, our operations would be negatively impacted, potentially materially. Pandemics or disease outbreaks may also impact hens or the food supply. Fire, bioterrorism, pandemics, extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, water rights restrictions, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, decrease production or availability of feed ingredients, or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from overtopped or breached wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production and processing facilities, labor shortages or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

The facility is expected to be operational late in our fiscal 2023 second quarter. Once fully operational, MeadowCreek will have the capacity to produce approximately 500 thousand pounds of weekly hard-cooked egg products. We also have ongoing construction projects to further expand the Company’s cage-free egg production capabilities. These projects include expanding our cage-free egg production at our Okeechobee, Florida, production facility. The project is designed to include the construction of two cage-free layer houses and one cage-free pullet house with capacity for approximately 400 thousand cage-free hens and 210 thousand pullets, respectively. Construction has commenced, with the first layer house planned to be finished by October 1, 2022, with the second layer house and project completion expected by February 1, 2023.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISK FACTORS; FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, securities, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors . In addition, because the following discussion includes numerous forward -looking statements relating to our business, securities, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and to the information set forth in the section of Part I immediately preceding Item 1 above under the caption “ Forward-Looking Statements .” COMPANY OVERVIEW Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs. Our fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to May 31. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States (“U.S”). In fiscal 2022, we sold approximately 1,083.8 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 20% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock as of May 28, 2022 of approximately 42.2 million layers and 11.5 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. We sell most of our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, companies servicing independent supermarkets in the U.S., food service distributors, and egg product consumers in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products. We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, organic, free-range, pasture- raised and brown eggs as specialty eggs for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as conventional eggs. While we report separate sales information for these types of eggs, there are a number of cost factors which are not specifically available for conventional or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. For further description of our business, refer to Part I. Item I. Business . HPAI We are closely monitoring the outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) , the latest of which was detected in commercial flocks in the U.S. in February 2022. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these detections do not present an immediate public health concern. There have been no positive tests for HPAI at any Cal-Maine Foods’ owned or contracted production facility as of July 19, 2022. The USDA division of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), reported that approximately 30.7 million commercial layer hens have been depopulated due to HPAI. Pullets impacted comprise approximately 1.0 million. According to APHIS, the most recently reported outbreaks of HPAI affecting commercial layer hens and pullets occurred June 7, 2022 and June 9, 2022, respectively. We believe the HPAI outbreak will continue to impact the overall supply of eggs until the layer hen flock is fully replenished. While no farm is immune from HPAI, we believe we have implemented and continue to maintain robust biosecurity programs across our locations. We are also working closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of this and future outbreaks and effectively manage our response, if needed. COVID-19 Since early 2020, the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak, characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets. We understand the challenges and difficult economic environment facing families in the communities where we live and work, and we are committed to helping where we can. We have provided food assistance to those in need by donating approximately 829 thousand dozen eggs in fiscal 2022. We believe we are taking all reasonable precautions in the management of our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, who work hard each day to produce eggs for our customers. As part of the nation’s food supply, we work in a critical infrastructure industry, and we believe we have a special responsibility to maintain our normal work schedule. As such, we are in regular communication with our managers across our operations and continue to closely monitor the situation in our facilities and in the communities where we live and work. We have implemented procedures designed to protect our employees, taking into account guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and other government health agencies, and we have strict sanitation protocols and biosecurity measures in place

There are no known indications that COVID-19 affects chickens or can be transferred through the food supply. We continue to proactively monitor and manage operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional related costs that we incurred or may incur in the future. The pandemic had a negative impact on our business through disruptions in the supply chain such as increased costs and limited availability of packaging supplies, increased labor costs, increased medical costs and, more recently, inflation. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, we spent $2.2 million and $2.3 million (excluding medical insurance claims) related to the pandemic and its effects, respectively. The majority of these expenses resulted from additional labor and increased cost of packaging materials, which are primarily reflected in cost of sales. Medical insurance claims related to COVID-19 paid during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were an additional $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Executive Overview of Results – Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2022, May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020 Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Net sales (in thousands) $ 1,777,159 $ 1,348,987 $ 1,351,609 Gross profit (in thousands) $ 337,059 $ 160,661 $ 179,588 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 1.579 $ 1.217 $ 1.231 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 1.712 $ 1.155 $ 1.220 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.571 $ 0.446 $ 0.409 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. Throughout the first three quarters of our fiscal year 2020, an oversupply of eggs negatively affected the price of conventional eggs and demand for specialty eggs was negatively impacted by the low conventional egg prices. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was down 21.9% compared with the prior-year period. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was 62.4% higher than the average price through the first three quarters in fiscal 2020 due to increased demand related to the onset of the pandemic, as consumers purchased more eggs in anticipation of preparing more meals at home. Consumer demand maintained a steady growth throughout our first three quarters of fiscal 2021 but began trending down during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers started to resume pre-pandemic activities. Our net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased $2.6 million compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the decrease in the selling price and volume of conventional eggs, partially offset by the increased volume of specialty eggs sold. We believe the decreased demand in foodservice seen throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell eggs for fiscal 2021 in the retail market due to the extra supply entering the retail channel from the foodservice channel. For fiscal 2022, we believe prices for conventional eggs were positively impacted by a better alignment of the size of the conventional production layer hen flock and customer and consumer demand through the first three fiscal quarters of 2022. Conventional egg prices further increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreased supply caused by the HPAI outbreak compounded with good customer demand. Throughout fiscal 2022 the hen numbers reported by the USDA remained below the five-year average. As of July 17, 2022, APHIS reported that approximately 30.7 million commercial table egg layer hens, or approximately 9.5% of the table egg layer flock based on February 2022 reported layer numbers, have been depopulated due to HPAI. Hen numbers reported by the USDA as of June 1, 2022, were 297.5 million, which represents 18.3 million fewer hens than a year ago. According to Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), for the 52 weeks ended June 5, 2022, which approximately aligns with our fiscal year 2022, conventional egg dozens sold in the U.S. at multi-retail outlets decreased 14.3%, while specialty egg dozens sold increased 13.2% versus the prior-year comparable period. Our conventional eggs dozens sold decreased 3.4% and specialty egg dozens sold increased 12.5% as compared to fiscal 2021. Gross profit increased $176.4 million to $337.1 million in fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients, increased processing costs and the decline in the volume of conventional eggs sold. For fiscal year 2022, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $6.31 per bushel for corn and $392.06 per ton for soybean meal,

The majority of these expenses resulted from additional labor and increased cost of packaging materials, which are primarily reflected in cost of sales. Medical insurance claims related to COVID-19 paid during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were an additional $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Executive Overview of Results – Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2022, May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020 Fiscal Years Ended May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Net sales (in thousands) $ 1,777,159 $ 1,348,987 $ 1,351,609 Gross profit (in thousands) $ 337,059 $ 160,661 $ 179,588 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 1.579 $ 1.217 $ 1.231 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 1.712 $ 1.155 $ 1.220 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.571 $ 0.446 $ 0.409 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. Throughout the first three quarters of our fiscal year 2020, an oversupply of eggs negatively affected the price of conventional eggs and demand for specialty eggs was negatively impacted by the low conventional egg prices. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was down 21.9% compared with the prior-year period. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was 62.4% higher than the average price through the first three quarters in fiscal 2020 due to increased demand related to the onset of the pandemic, as consumers purchased more eggs in anticipation of preparing more meals at home. Consumer demand maintained a steady growth throughout our first three quarters of fiscal 2021 but began trending down during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers started to resume pre-pandemic activities. Our net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased $2.6 million compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the decrease in the selling price and volume of conventional eggs, partially offset by the increased volume of specialty eggs sold. We believe the decreased demand in foodservice seen throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell eggs for fiscal 2021 in the retail market due to the extra supply entering the retail channel from the foodservice channel. For fiscal 2022, we believe prices for conventional eggs were positively impacted by a better alignment of the size of the conventional production layer hen flock and customer and consumer demand through the first three fiscal quarters of 2022. Conventional egg prices further increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreased supply caused by the HPAI outbreak compounded with good customer demand. Throughout fiscal 2022 the hen numbers reported by the USDA remained below the five-year average. As of July 17, 2022, APHIS reported that approximately 30.7 million commercial table egg layer hens, or approximately 9.5% of the table egg layer flock based on February 2022 reported layer numbers, have been depopulated due to HPAI. Hen numbers reported by the USDA as of June 1, 2022, were 297.5 million, which represents 18.3 million fewer hens than a year ago. According to Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), for the 52 weeks ended June 5, 2022, which approximately aligns with our fiscal year 2022, conventional egg dozens sold in the U.S. at multi-retail outlets decreased 14.3%, while specialty egg dozens sold increased 13.2% versus the prior-year comparable period. Our conventional eggs dozens sold decreased 3.4% and specialty egg dozens sold increased 12.5% as compared to fiscal 2021. Gross profit increased $176.4 million to $337.1 million in fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients, increased processing costs and the decline in the volume of conventional eggs sold. For fiscal year 2022, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $6.31 per bushel for corn and $392.06 per ton for soybean meal, Table of Contents 25 representing increases of 38.3% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2021. Feed costs started trending higher midway through the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and then again near the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Beginning in August 2020, the grain markets, particularly corn, have been negatively affected by many factors, including weather-related production and yield shortfalls, increased export demand and ongoing disruptions from the COVID-19 global pandemic. These factors continued into our fiscal 2022 and as other factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war, increased fuel costs, transportation and fertilizers prices and strong export demand and restrictions further compounded the existing issues that contributed to near-historical low stocks-to-use ratios for corn worldwide and overall higher feed ingredient cost and price volatility. We continue to execute our growth strategy of remaining a low-cost provider of shell eggs and growth of our specialty eggs and egg products through additional investments in cage-free facilities and selective acquisitions. In fiscal 2022, we acquired the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC (“Red River”), which owns and operates a specialty shell egg production complex with approximately 1.7 million cage-free laying hens, cage-free pullet capacity, a feed mill, processing plant, related offices and outbuildings and related equipment located on approximately 400 acres near Bogata, Texa s. We also announced new capital projects with estimated costs of $105 million that will expand our cage-free production and capacity by 2.2 million cage-free hens.

We saw these consumer preferences begin to shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers began to resume out-of-home dining and prepared fewer meals at home. - Specialty egg sales increased $109.1 million, or 20.2%, for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to a 16.7% increase in the volume of specialty dozens sold and a 3.0% increase in specialty egg prices. Changes in price resulted in a $18.8 million increase and change in volume resulted in a $90.3 million increase in net sales, respectively. Our specialty egg sales also benefitted from our additional cage-free production capacity. Cage-free egg sales for fiscal 2022 were 22.1% of our total net shell egg sales.

COST OF SALES Cost of sales for fiscal 2022 were $1,440.1 million compared to $1,188.3 million for fiscal 2021. Cost of sales consi sts of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs from outside producers, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization and other related farm production costs.

Also, higher feed costs, which began to rise in our third quarter of fiscal 2021, are capitalized in our flocks during pullet production and increased our amortization expense. - We had higher facility expense as more cage-free facilities came into production. Processing, packaging, and warehouse - Cost of packaging materials increased 11.9% compared to fiscal 2021 as supply chain constraints initially caused by the pandemic increased costs for packaging products and manufacturers implemented pandemic surcharges. Costs also increased due to rising inflation. - Labor costs increased 14.4% due to wage increases in response to labor shortages, primarily due to the pandemic and its effects. - Dozens processed increased 5.0% compared to fiscal 2021, which resulted in an $11.4 million increase in costs.

Looking forward to fiscal 2023, market indications point to higher corn and soybean prices and greater volatility tied to the Russia-Ukraine war and higher export demand. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 19.0% for fiscal 2022, compared to 11.9% for fiscal 2021. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients, increased processing costs and the decline in the volume of conventional eggs sold. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SGA") include costs of marketing, distribution, accounting, and corporate overhead.

However, our specialty egg expense increased only 0.9%, primarily due to increased sales to other Eggland’s Best, Inc. (“EB”) franchisees, including unconsolidated affiliates, Specialty Eggs, LLC and Southwest Specialty Eggs, LLC, that were responsible for the franchise fees, advertising and promotion costs associated with those sales resulting in reduced costs for us. Also, the strong conventional market diminished the need to promote specialty eggs; and as a result, EB temporarily reduced the related franchise fees for certain specialty egg products to encourage continued production of these products. Delivery expense - The increased delivery expense is primarily due to the increase in fuel and labor costs for both our fleet and contract trucking. Other expenses - The increase in other expenses is primarily due to property losses incurred that were not covered by insurance as well as increased premiums for property and casualty insurance programs. We also accrued an additional $1.1 million in property taxes due to the Red River acquisition. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) As a result of the above, our operating income was $143.5 million for fiscal 2022, compared to operating loss of $26.3 million for fiscal 2021.

Table of Contents 29 The Company recorded interest income of $988 thousand in fiscal 2022, compared to $2.8 million in fiscal 2021. We recorded interest expense of $403 thousand and $213 thousand in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to commitment fees on our Credit Facility described below. Patronage dividends, which represent distributions from our membership in EB, increased $1.1 million or 12.5%. Patronage dividends are paid once a year based on EB’s profits and its available cash. Equity in income from unconsolidated entities for fiscal 2022 was $1.9 million compared to $622 thousand for fiscal 2021, due to increased specialty egg prices as well as increased sales volume resulting from our additional investment in Southwest Specialty to expand its operations. Other, net for fiscal 2022 was income of $9.8 million compared to $4.1 million for fiscal 2021. The majority of the increase is due to our acquisition of the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River as we recognized a $4.5 million gain due to the remeasurement of our equity investment, along with the $1.6 million payments related to review and adjustment of our various marketing agreements. INCOME TAXES For the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022, our pre-tax income was $166.0 million, compared to pre-tax loss of $9.9 million for fiscal 2021. Income tax expense of $33.6 million was recorded for fiscal 2022 with an effective tax rate of 20.2%. Included in fiscal 2022 income tax expense is the discrete tax benefit of $8.3 million discussed in Note 2 – Acquisition of Part II. Item 8. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, income tax expense was $41.9 million with an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.2%. For fiscal 2021, income tax benefit was $12.0 million. Excluding the impact of discrete items related to a $12.4 million net tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2021 in connection with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), our income tax benefit for the comparable period of fiscal 2021 was $2.2 million, which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.7%. At May 28, 2022, the Company had an income tax receivable of $42.1 million compared to $42.5 million at May 29, 2021. The income tax receivable is related to the Company’s decision to carryback fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 taxable net operating losses to recover a portion of taxes paid in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2022, the Company filed both federal carryback tax returns, and we believe we will receive the refunds during our third fiscal quarter of 2023. Items causing our effective tax rate to differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% are state income taxes, certain federal tax credits and certain items included in income or loss for financial reporting purposes that are not included in taxable income or loss for income tax purposes, including tax exempt interest income, certain nondeductible expenses, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $209 thousand for fiscal 2022 compared to no such income or loss for fiscal 2021. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for fiscal 2022 was $132.7 million, or $2.73 per basic and $2.72 per diluted share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for fiscal 2021. Fiscal Year Ended May 29, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2020 The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 can be found in Part II.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working Capital and Current Ratio Our working capital at May 28, 2022 was $476.8 million, compared to $429.8 million at May 29, 2021. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 3.58 at May 28, 2022 compared to 5.77

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working Capital and Current Ratio Our working capital at May 28, 2022 was $476.8 million, compared to $429.8 million at May 29, 2021. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 3.58 at May 28, 2022 compared to 5.77 Table of Contents 30 at May 29, 2021. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Due to seasonal factors described in Part I. Item I. Business – Seasonality , we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $126.2 million for fiscal year 2022 compared with $26.1 million for fiscal year 2021. The increase in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and processing costs. The increase in accounts payables, accrued expenses and other liabilities is primarily due to $62.3 million balance for dividends and income tax payables as of May 28, 2022. Cash Flows from Investing Activities We continue to invest in our facilities, with $72.4 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2022, compared to $95.1 million in fiscal 2021. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment was $8.3 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $3.4 million for in fiscal 2021. We also acquired the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River during our first quarter of fiscal 2022 for $44.8 million, net of cash acquired. Purchases of investments were $98.2 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $88.3 million in fiscal 2021. Sales and maturities of investment securities were $92.7 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $129.1 million for fiscal 2021. We received $400 thousand in distributions from unconsolidated entity in fiscal 2022 compared to $6.7 million for fiscal 2021. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We paid dividends totaling $6.1 million and $1.7 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Purchases of common stock by treasury of $1.1 million and $871 thousand were made to satisfy tax withholding obligations for employees in connection with the vesting of restricted common stock. Cash payments of $215 thousand and $205 thousand were made on our finance lease. As of May 28, 2022, cash increased $1.7 million since May 29, 2021, compared to a decrease of $20.8 million during fiscal 2021. Credit Facility We had no long-term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 and 2021. On November 15, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a five-year term. The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s previously existing credit agreement dated July 10, 2018. The Credit Agreement provides for an increased senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million. As of May 28, 2022, no amounts were borrowed under the Credit Facility. We have $4.1 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were issued under our Credit Facility for the benefit of certain insurance companies. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 10 – Credit Facility for further information regarding our long-term debt.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations.

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described below. Table of Contents 32 BUSINESS COMBINATION S The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant judgment exists in valuing certain intangible assets. and the most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the asset’s expected useful lives. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is determined internally and requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and significant judgment is required as management determines the fair market value for those assets. Due to inherent industry uncertainties including volatile egg prices and feed costs, unanticipated market changes, events, or circumstances may occur that could affect the estimates and assumptions used, which could result in subsequent impairments. INVENTORIES Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. If market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower, we record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value. The cost associated with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s productive life, generally one to two years. Judgment exists in determining the flock’s productive life including factors such as laying rate and egg size, molt cycles, and customer demand. Furthermore, other factors such as hen type or weather conditions could affect the productive life. These factors could make our estimates of productive life differ from actual results. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss. GOODWILL As a result of acquiring businesses, the Company has $44.0 million of goodwill on May 28, 2022. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. The Company has determined that all of our locations share similar economic characteristics and support each other in the production of eggs and customer support. Therefore, we aggregate all our locations as a single reporting unit for testing goodwill for impairment. When the Company acquires a new location, we determine whether it should be integrated into our single reporting unit or treated as a separate reporting unit. Historically, we have concluded that acquired operations should be integrated into our single reporting unit due to the operational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant changes in management that occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing similar economic characteristics with the rest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes part of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it no longer represents the particular acquired operations that gave rise to the goodwill. We may conclude that a business acquired in the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately for goodwill impairment. At May 28, 2022, goodwill represented 3.1% of total assets and 2.9% of stockholders’ equity. Judgment exists in management’s evaluation of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg industry environment, cost inputs such as feed ingredients and overall financial performance. Furthermore, judgment exists in the evaluation of the threshold of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur that could negatively affect our operating conditions. During our annual impairment test in fiscal 2022, we determined that goodwill passed the qualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary.

Table of Contents 33 REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 14 – Revenue Recognition in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ As the estimates noted above are based on historical information, we do not believe that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue. However, if actual results varied significantly from our estimates it could expose us to material gains or losses. LOSS CONTINGENCIES The Company evaluates whether a loss contingency exists, and if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. There were no loss contingency reserves for the past three fiscal years. Our evaluation of whether loss contingencies exist primarily relates to litigation matters. The outcome of litigation is uncertain due to, among other things, uncertainties regarding the facts will be established during the proceedings, uncertainties regarding how the law will be applied to the facts established, and uncertainties regarding the calculation of any potential damages or the costs of any potential injunctive relief. If the facts discovered or the Company’s assumptions change, future reserves for loss contingencies may be required. Results of operations may be materially affected by losses or a loss contingency reserve resulting from adverse legal proceedings. INCOME TAXES We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty exist with management’s application of tax regulations and evaluation of the more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax settlement could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and our results of operations.

Table of Contents 33 REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 14 – Revenue Recognition in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ As the estimates noted above are based on historical information, we do not believe that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of conventional eggs, which are subject to significant price fluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as conventional shell egg prices. Our exposure to market risk also includes changes in the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter into contracts for future purchases of corn and soybean meal, and as part of these contracts, we may lock-in the basis portion of our grain purchases several months in advance and commit to purchase organic ingredients to help assure supply. Ordinarily, we do not enter long-term contracts beyond a year to purchase corn and soybean meal or hedge against increases in the price of corn and soybean meal. The following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed costs per dozen as feed ingredient pricing varies: Change in price per bushel of corn $ (0.84) $ (0.56) $ (0.28) $ 0.00 $ 0.28 $ 0.56 $ 0.84 Change in price per ton Soybean Meal $ (76.50) 0.511 0.521 0.531 0.541 0.551 0.561 0.571 $ (51.00) 0.521 0.531 0.541 0.551 0.561 0.571 0.581 $ (25.50) 0.531 0.541 0.551 0.561 0.571 0.581 0.591 $ 0.00 0.541 0.551 0.561 0.571 (a) 0.581 0.591 0.601 $ 25.50 0.551 0.561 0.571 0.581 0.591 0.601 0.611 $ 51.00 0.561 0.571 0.581 0.591 0.601 0.611 0.621 $ 76.50 0.571 0.581 0.591 0.601 0.611 0.621 0.631 (a) Based on 2022 actual costs, table flexes feed cost inputs to show $0.01 impacts to per dozen egg feed production costs. INTEREST RATE RISK The fair value of our debt is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In November 2021, we entered into a $250 million Credit Facility which bears interest at a variable rate. No amounts were outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2022. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK At May 28, 2022, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 9.5 months, and the composite credit rating of the holdings are A / A2 / A (S&P / Moody’s / Fitch). CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas, except that at May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, 27.9% and 23.8%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club). No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 28, 2022, and the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 28, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2022, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entities’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable.

Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if Table of Contents 36 there is no one best estimate. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries either disclose the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries disclose significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries believe there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We identified litigation and claims as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing management’s judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims. Specifically, auditing management’s determination of whether any contingent loss arising from the related litigation and claims is probable, reasonably possible or remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the sensitivity of the issue. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during the Audit Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the controls relating to the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings and claims, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims. These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, evaluating the sufficiency of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ disclosures related to legal proceedings and claims and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ legal contingencies. /s/ Frost, PLLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.

Table of Contents 42 Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packing and sale of fresh shell eggs, including nutritionally-enhanced, cage-free, organic, free-range, pasture-raised and brown eggs. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells the majority of its shell eggs in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and of majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. Each of the year-to-date periods ended May 28, 2022 , May 29, 2021, and May 30, 2020, included 52 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain bank accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. At May 29, 2021, checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled $ 7.5 million, respectively. Investment Securities Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months, as available-for-sale. We classify these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available -for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, reserves for credit losses were $ 775 thousand and $ 795 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers

The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. At May 29, 2021, checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled $ 7.5 million, respectively. Investment Securities Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months, as available-for-sale. We classify these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available -for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, reserves for credit losses were $ 775 thousand and $ 795 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers Table of Contents 43 based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition and credit history. Collateral is generally not required. The Company minimizes exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. In determining our reserve for credit losses, receivables are assigned an expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors. At May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, one customer accounted for approximately 27.9 % and 23.8 % of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively. Inventories Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The cost associated with flocks, consisting principally of chicks, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during a growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over the productive lives of the flocks, generally one to two years . Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. The Company does not disclose the gross cost and accumulated amortization with respect to its flock inventories since this information is not utilized by management in the operation of the Company. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property, plant, and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant, and equipment as part of the asset to which it relates and amortizes such cost over the asset’s estimated useful life. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement and classifies it as an operating lease or finance lease. We recognize the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term as a right-of-use ("ROU") asset on our balance sheet. A lease liability is recorded to represent our obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. These assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Finance lease right-of-use asset, Operating lease right-of-use asset, Current portion of finance lease obligation, Current portion of operating lease obligation, Long-term finance lease obligation, and Long-term operating lease obligation. The Company records ROU assets and lease obligations based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. When the rate implicit in the lease is not easily determinable, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to calculate the present value of the future lease payments. The Company elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease obligations for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has a 20% to 50% interest in other entities or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these entities. Nonmarketable investments in which the Company has less than a 20% interest and in which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are initially recorded at cost, and periodically reviewed for impairment. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment.

Table of Contents 44 Intangible Assets Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Accrued Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Treasury Stock Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The grant of restricted stock through the Company’s share-based compensation plans is funded through the issuance of treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares in accordance with the Company’s share- based compensation plans are credited or charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value using the average-cost method. Revenue Recognition and Delivery Costs Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 14 – Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. Advertising Costs The Company expensed advertising costs as incurred of $ 12.6 million, $ 11.7 million, and $ 9.0 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s policy with respect to evaluating uncertain tax positions is based upon whether management believes it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained upon review by the taxing authorities. The tax positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company initially and subsequently measures the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company records interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Based upon management’s assessment, there are no uncertain tax positions expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares, to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires the

ASC 718 requires the Table of Contents 45 benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 16 – Stock Compensation Plans for more information. Business Combinations The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities are determined internally and requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Loss Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies Effective May 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The guidance replaces the prior “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model and requires measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company adopted the guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company evaluated its current methodology of estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivables portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the “expected loss” model under the amended guidance. The Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance and recorded a $ 422 thousand cumulative increase to retained earnings at May 31, 2020. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of Contents 46 Note 2 – Acquisition Effective on May 30, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 50 % membership interest in Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC (“Red River”), including certain liabilities. As a result of the acquisition, Red River became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Red River owns and operates a specialty shell egg production complex with approximately 1.7 million cage-free laying hens, cage-free pullet capacity, feed mill, processing plant, related offices and outbuildings and related equipment located on approximately 400 acres near Bogata, Texas. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Red River and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date: Cash consideration paid $ 48,500 Fair value of the Company's equity interest in Red River held before the business combination 48,500 $ 97,000 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash $ 3,677 Accounts receivable, net 1,980 Inventory 8,789 Property, plant and equipment 85,002 Liabilities assumed ( 2,448 ) Deferred income taxes ( 8,481 ) Total identifiable net assets 88,519 Goodwill 8,481 $ 97,000 Cash and accounts receivable acquired along with liabilities assumed were valued at their carrying value which approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Inventory consisted primarily of flock, feed ingredients, packaging, and egg inventory. Flock inventory was valued at carrying value as management believes that their carrying value best approximates their fair value. Feed ingredients, packaging and egg inventory were all valued based on market prices as of May 30, 2021. Property, plant and equipment were valued utilizing the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the assets and subtracting any depreciation resulting from physical deterioration and/or functional or economic obsolescence. The Company recognized a gain of $ 4.5 million as a result of remeasuring to fair value its 50 % equity interest in Red River held before the business combination. The gain was recorded in other income and expense under the heading “Other, net” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The acquisition of Red River resulted in a discrete tax benefit of $ 8.3 million, which includes a $ 7.3 million decrease in deferred income tax expense related to the outside-basis of our equity investment in Red River, with a corresponding non-recurring, non-cash $ 955,000 reduction to income taxes expense on the non- taxable remeasurement gain associated with the acquisition. As part of the acquisition accounting, the Company also recorded an $ 8.5 million deferred tax liability for the difference in the inside-basis of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of goodwill. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Gross realized gains for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 181 thousand, $ 456 thousand, and $ 278 thousand, respectively. Gross realized losses for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $ 76 thousand, $ 19 thousand, and $ 6 thousand, respectively. There was no allowance for credit losses at May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Contractual maturities of investment securities at May 28, 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Estimated Fair Value Within one year $ 58,970 1-5 years 56,459 Total $ 115,429 Noncurrent Proceeds from sales and maturities of noncurrent investment securities were $ 4.9 million, $ 54 thousand, and $ 1.2 million, during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross realized gains on those sales and maturities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 were $ 2.2 million and $ 611 thousand, respectively. There were no realized losses for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. Note 4 - Fair Value Measures The Company is required to categorize both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy.

A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ● Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including: o Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets o Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets o Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability o Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data ● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities The disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Lease obligations: The carrying value of the Company’s lease obligations is at its present value which approximates fair value.

The Company uses stop-loss insurance to limit its portion of medical claims to $ 225,000 per occurrence. The Company's expenses including accruals for incurred but not reported claims were approximately $ 24.6 million, $ 21.7 million, and $ 17.8 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The liability recorded for incurred but not reported claims was $ 2.8 million and $ 2.4 million as of May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, respectively and are classified as “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a KSOP plan that covers substantially all employees (the “Plan”). The Company makes contributions to the Plan at a rate of 3 % of participants' eligible compensation, plus an additional amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Contributions can be made in cash or the Company's Common Stock, and vest immediately. The Company's cash contributions to the Plan were $ 3.9 million in fiscal year 2022 and $ 3.8 million in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. The Company did no t make direct contributions of the Company’s Common Stock in fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020. Dividends on the Company’s Common Stock are paid to the Plan in cash. The Plan acquires the Company’s Common Stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ, by using the dividends and the Company’s cash contribution to purchase shares in the public markets. The Plan sells Common Stock on the NASDAQ to pay benefits to Plan participants. Participants may make contributions to the Plan up to the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Company does not match participant contributions. The Company has deferred compensation agreements with certain officers for payments to be made over specified periods beginning when the officers reach age 65 or over as specified in the agreements. Amounts accrued for the agreements are based upon deferred compensation earned over the estimated remaining service period of each officer. Payments made under these agreements were $ 170 thousand, in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, and $ 150 thousand in fiscal year 2020. The liability recorded related to these agreements was $ 1.1 million and $ 1.4 million at May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, respectively. Table of Contents 52 Effective December 1, 2021, the Company amended and restated its deferred compensation plan (the “Amended DC Plan”). The Amended DC Plan, expanded eligibility for participation from named officers only to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, expanded the investment options available and added the ability of participants to make elective deferrals. The awards issued under the Amended DC Plan were $ 340 thousand, $ 279 thousand, and $ 266 thousand in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Payments made under the Amended DC Plan were $ 480 thousand and $ 55 thousand in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The liability recorded for the Amended DC Plan was $ 4.5 million and $ 4.1 million at May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, respectively. Deferred compensation expense for both plans totaled $ 258 thousand, $ 1.6 million and $ 621 thousand in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Postretirement Medical Plan The Company maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan to provide limited health benefits to certain qualified retired employees and officers. Retired non-officers and spouses are eligible for coverage until attainment of Medicare eligibility, at which time coverage ceases. Retired officers and spouses are eligible for lifetime benefits under the plan. Officers, who retired prior to May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A and B. Officers, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. The plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”), whereby an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, this expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employees’ approximate period of employment. The liability associated with the plan was $ 2.9 million and $ 3.4 million at May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, respectively. The remaining disclosures associated with ASC 715 are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements. Note 10 - Credit Facility For fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, interest was $ 403 thousand, $ 213 thousand, and $ 498 thousand, respectively. On November 15, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a five -year term. The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s previously existing credit agreement dated July 10, 2018. The Credit Agreement provides for an increased senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or “Revolver”), in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 15 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 15 million sublimit for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting, with the consent of BMO Harris Bank N.A. (the “Administrative Agent”), an increase in the Credit Facility in the aggregate up to $ 200 million by adding one or more incremental senior secured term loans or increasing one or more times the revolving commitments under the Revolver. No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of May 28, 2022 or May 29, 2021 or during fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The Company had $ 4.1 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility at May 28, 2022. The interest rate in connection with loans made under the Credit Facility is based on, at the Company’s election, either the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Eurodollar Rate” means the reserve adjusted rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one , two , three , six or twelve months (as selected by the Company) are quoted. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1 % per annum, subject to certain interest rate floors. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility payable quarterly from 0.15 % to 0.25 % in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Credit Agreement contains customary provisions regarding replacement of the Eurodollar Rate. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly-owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent.

Table of Contents 53 The Credit Agreement for the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested quarterly of no greater than 50 %; and (ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth at all times of $ 700 Million plus 50 % of net income (if net income is positive) less permitted restricted payments for each fiscal quarter after November 27, 2021. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr.’s spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100 % of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50 % of the Company's voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement. Further, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, payment of dividends under the Company's current dividend policy of one-third of the Company's net income computed in accordance with GAAP and payment of other dividends or repurchases by the Company of its capital stock is allowed, as long as after giving effect to such dividend payments or repurchases no default has occurred and is continuing and the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals at least $50 million. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due under the Credit Facility and foreclosure of the collateral securing the Credit Facility. At May 28, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility. Note 11 - Accrued Dividends Payable and Dividends per Common Share We accrue dividends at the end of each quarter according to our dividend policy adopted by our Board of Directors. The Company pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third ( 1/3 ) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60 th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company pays dividends to shareholders of record on the 65 th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15 th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the last quarter for which a dividend was paid. On our consolidated statement of income, we determine dividends per common share in accordance with the computation in the following table (in thousands, except per share data): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. $ 109,986 $ ( 4,244 ) $ 132,650 $ 2,060 Cumulative losses to be recovered prior to payment of divided at beginning of period — — ( 4,244 ) ( 1,370 ) Net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend $ 109,986 $ — $ — $ — 1/3 of net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend $ 36,662 — Common stock outstanding (shares) 44,140 44,058 Class A common stock outstanding (shares) 4,800 4,800 Total common stock outstanding (shares) 48,940 48,858 Dividends per common share* $ 0.749 $ — $ 0.874 $ 0.034 *Dividends per common share = 1/3 of Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend ÷ Total common stock outstanding (shares).

Table of Contents 54 Note 12 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”), holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company’s Restated Charter identifies family members of Mr. Adams (“Immediate Family Members”) and arrangements and entities that are permitted to receive and hold shares of Class A Common Stock, with ten votes per share, without such shares converting into shares of Common Stock, with one vote per share (“Permitted Transferees”). The Permitted Transferees include arrangements and entities such as revocable trusts and limited liability companies that could hold Class A Common Stock for the benefit of Immediate Family Members. Each Permitted Transferee must have a relationship, specifically defined in the Restated Charter, with another Permitted Transferee or an Immediate Family Member. A share of Class A Common Stock transferred to a person other than a Permitted Transferee would automatically convert into Common Stock with one vote per share. Additionally, the Restated Charter includes a sunset provision pursuant to which all of the outstanding Class A Common Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock if: (a) less than 4,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees, or (b) if less than 4,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees. Note 13 - Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on the weighted average Common Stock and Class A Common Stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.

Pricing for the most part is determined when the Company and the customer agree upon the specific order, which establishes the contract for that order. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 62.7 million, $ 52.7 million, and $ 52.2 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Returns and Refunds Some of our contracts include a guaranteed sale clause, pursuant to which we credit the customer’s account for product that the customer is unable to sell before expiration. The Company records an allowance of returns and refunds by using historical return data and comparing to current period sales and accounts receivable. The allowance is recorded as a reduction in sales with a corresponding reduction in trade accounts receivable. Sales Incentives Provided to Customers The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ Disaggregation of Revenue The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 Conventional shell egg sales $ 378,190 $ 205,987 $ 1,061,995 $ 766,284 Specialty shell egg sales 186,518 131,243 648,838 539,780 Egg products 26,488 10,997 60,004 36,733 Other 1,768 1,571 6,322 6,190 $ 592,964 $ 349,798 $ 1,777,159 $ 1,348,987 Contract Costs The Company can incur costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. If the amortization period of these costs is less than one year, they are expensed as incurred. When the amortization period is greater than one year, a contract asset is recognized and is amortized over the contract life as a reduction in net sales. As of May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021, the balance for contract assets is immaterial. Contract Balances The Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from delivery. There are rarely contract assets or liabilities related to performance under the contract.

Table of Contents 55 Note 14 - Revenue Recognition Satisfaction of Performance Obligation The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from agreements with customers based on the customer placing an order for products. Pricing for the most part is determined when the Company and the customer agree upon the specific order, which establishes the contract for that order. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 62.7 million, $ 52.7 million, and $ 52.2 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Returns and Refunds Some of our contracts include a guaranteed sale clause, pursuant to which we credit the customer’s account for product that the customer is unable to sell before expiration. The Company records an allowance of returns and refunds by using historical return data and comparing to current period sales and accounts receivable. The allowance is recorded as a reduction in sales with a corresponding reduction in trade accounts receivable. Sales Incentives Provided to Customers The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ Disaggregation of Revenue The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 Conventional shell egg sales $ 378,190 $ 205,987 $ 1,061,995 $ 766,284 Specialty shell egg sales 186,518 131,243 648,838 539,780 Egg products 26,488 10,997 60,004 36,733 Other 1,768 1,571 6,322 6,190 $ 592,964 $ 349,798 $ 1,777,159 $ 1,348,987 Contract Costs The Company can incur costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.

Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The State of Texas (the “State”) asserted claims based on the Company’s and WCF’s alleged violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices—Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 17.41-17.63 (“DTPA”). The Table of Contents 59 State claimed that the Company and WCF offered shell eggs at excessive or exorbitant prices during the COVID-19 state of emergency and made misleading statements about shell egg prices. The State sought temporary and permanent injunctions against the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $ 100,000 in damages. On August 13, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the State’s original petition with prejudice. On September 11, 2020, the State filed a notice of appeal, which was assigned to the Texas Court of Appeals for the First District. The State filed its opening brief on December 7, 2020. The Company and WCF filed their response on February 8, 2021. On February 11, 2022, the Texas Court of Appeals heard oral argument, but as of the date of this Annual Report the Texas Court of Appeals has not issued a ruling. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al. On April 30, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:20- cv-461, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. The defendants include numerous grocery stores, retailers, producers, and farms. Plaintiffs assert that defendants violated the DTPA by allegedly demanding exorbitant or excessive prices for eggs during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs request certification of a class of all consumers who purchased eggs in Texas sold, distributed, produced, or handled by any of the defendants during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from selling eggs at a price more than 10% greater than the price of eggs prior to the declaration of the state of emergency and damages in the amount of $ 10,000 per violation, or $ 250,000 for each violation impacting anyone over 65 years old. On December 1, 2020, the Company and certain other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended class action complaint. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to strike, and the motion to dismiss and related proceedings were referred to a United States magistrate judge. On July 14, 2021, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to the court that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be granted and the case be dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 20, 2021, the court dismissed the case without prejudice. On July 13, 2022, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to set aside or amend the judgment to amend their complaint. On March 15, 2022, plaintiffs filed a second suit against the Company and several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-246, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division alleging the same assertions as laid out in the first complaint. The Company has not yet filed a responsive pleading and there is currently no deadline to do so. Management believes the risk of material loss related to both matters to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and The Kellogg Company. On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. On May 2, 2022, the court set trial for October 24, 2022. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, and on March 28, 2022, the court dismissed the Company with prejudice. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: two earlier trials based on substantially the same facts and legal arguments

Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-246, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division alleging the same assertions as laid out in the first complaint. The Company has not yet filed a responsive pleading and there is currently no deadline to do so. Management believes the risk of material loss related to both matters to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and The Kellogg Company. On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. On May 2, 2022, the court set trial for October 24, 2022. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, and on March 28, 2022, the court dismissed the Company with prejudice. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: two earlier trials based on substantially the same facts and legal arguments Table of Contents 60 resulted in findings of no conspiracy and/or damages; this trial will be before a different judge and jury in a different court than prior related cases; there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and there are requests for damages other than compensatory damages (i.e., injunction and treble money damages). State of Oklahoma Water shed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc. and affiliates, Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc. and its affiliate, George’s, Inc. and its affiliate, Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages has been dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief unless the court orders substantial affirmative remediation. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100 % of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. The trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. The case was tried without a jury, and the court has not yet issued its ruling. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Other Matters In addition to the above, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Note 19 - Related Party Transaction On August 24, 2020, Mrs. Jean Reed Adams, the wife of the Company’s late founder Fred R. Adams, Jr., and the Fred R. Adams, Jr. Daughters’ Trust, dated July 20, 2018 (the “Daughters’ Trust”), of which the daughters of Mr. Adams are beneficiaries (together, the “Selling Stockholders”), completed a registered secondary public offering of 6,900,000 shares of Common Stock held by them, pursuant to a previously disclosed Agreement Regarding Common Stock (the “Agreement”) filed as an exhibit to this report. Mrs. Adams and the Daughters’ Trust advised the Company that they were conducting the offering in order to pay estate taxes related to the settlement of Mr. Adam’s estate and to obtain liquidity. The public offering was made pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-227742), including the Prospectus contained therein dated October 9, 2018, and a related Prospectus Supplement dated August 19, 2020, each of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The public offering involved only the sale of shares of Common Stock that were already outstanding, and thus the Company did not issue any new shares or raise any additional capital in the offering. The expenses of the offering (not including the underwriting discount and legal fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Selling Stockholders, which were paid by the Selling Stockholders) paid by the Company were $ 1.1 million. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Selling Stockholders reimbursed the Company $ 551 thousand.

In our opinion, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as May 28, 2022, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated July 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entities’ internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCOAB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting An entities’ internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entities’ internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entities; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entities are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entities; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entities’ assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Frost, PLLC Little Rock, Arkansas July 19, 2022
