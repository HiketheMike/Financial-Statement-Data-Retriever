19 our customers’ future needs for cage-free and conventional eggs. Due to these uncertainties, we may over-estimate future demand for cage-free eggs, which could increase our costs unnecessarily, or we may under-estimate future demand for cage-free eggs, which could harm us competitively. If our competitors obtain non-cancelable long-term contracts to provide cage-free eggs to our existing or potential customers, then there may be decreased demand for our cage-free eggs due to these lost potential sales. If we and our competitors increase cage-free egg production and there is no commensurate increase in demand for cage-free eggs, this overproduction could lead to an oversupply of cage-free eggs, reducing the sales price for specialty eggs and our return on capital investments in cage-free production. Failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations, including environmental regulations, could harm our operating results, financial condition, and reputation. Further, we may incur significant costs to comply with any such regulations. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control, waste disposal, and other areas of our business. As a fully-integrated shell egg producer, our shell egg facilities are subject to regulation and inspection by the USDA, OSHA, EPA and FDA, as well as state and local health and agricultural agencies, among others. All of our shell egg production and feed mill facilities are subject to FDA, EPA and OSHA regulation and inspections. In addition, rules are often proposed that, if adopted as proposed, could increase our costs. Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not limited to wastewater discharge permits and manure and litter land applications. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or fail to obtain necessary permits, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties or other sanctions, our reputation could be harmed, and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, it is possible that we will be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. Climate change and legal or regulatory responses may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Extreme weather events, such as derechos, wildfires, drought, tornadoes, hurricanes, storms, floods or other natural disasters could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In fact, derechos, fires, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes have affected our facilities or the facilities of other egg producers in the past. Increased global temperatures and more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events, which may be exacerbated by climate change, may cause crop and livestock areas to become unsuitable, including due to water scarcity or high or unpredictable temperatures, which may result in much greater stress on food systems and more pronounced food insecurity globally. Lower global crop production, including corn and soybean meal, which are the primary feed ingredients that support the health of our animals, may result in significantly higher prices for these commodity inputs, impact our ability to source the commodities we use to feed our flocks, and negatively impact our ability to maintain or grow our operations. Climate change may increasingly expose workers and animals to high heat and humidity stressors that adversely impact poultry production and our costs. Increased greenhouse gas emissions may also negatively impact air quality, soil quality and water quality, which may hamper our ability to support our operations, particularly in higher water- and soil-stressed regions. Increasing frequency of severe weather events, whether tied to climate change or any other cause, may negatively impact our ability to raise poultry and produce eggs profitably or to operate our transportation and logistics supply chains. Regulatory controls and market pricing may continue to drive the costs of fossil -based fuels higher, which could negatively impact our ability to source commodities necessary to operate our farms or plants and our current fleet of vehicles. These changes may cause us to change, significantly, our day-to-day business operations and our strategy. Climate change and extreme weather events may also impact demand for our products given evolution of consumer food preferences. Even if we take measures to position our business in anticipation of such changes, future compliance with legal or regulatory requirements may require significant management time, oversight and enterprise expense. We may also incur significant expense tied to regulatory fines if laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our business practices. We can make no assurances that our efforts to prepare for these adverse events will be in line with future market and regulatory expectations and our access to capital to support our business may also be adversely impacted. Current and future litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and adversely affect our business reputation. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur liabilities due to adverse judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. For 20 a discussion of our ongoing legal proceedings see Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings below and Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16 – Commitments and Contingencies . Such lawsuits are expensive to defend, divert management’s attention, and may result in significant adverse judgments or settlements. Legal proceedings may expose us to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business reputation and customer preference for our products and brands. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RISK FACTORS Weak or unstable economic conditions, including continued high inflation and interest rates, could negatively impact our business. Weak or unstable economic conditions, including continued high inflation and interest rates, may adversely affect our business by: ● Limiting our access to capital markets or increasing the cost of capital we may need to grow or operate our business; ● Changing consumer spending and habits and demand for eggs, particularly higher-priced eggs; ● Restricting the supply of energy sources or increasing our cost to procure energy; or ● Reducing the availability of feed ingredients, packaging material, and other raw materials, or increasing the cost of these items. Deterioration of economic conditions could also negatively impact: ● The financial condition of our suppliers, which may make it more difficult for them to supply raw materials; ● The financial condition of our customers, which may decrease demand for eggs or increase our bad debt expense; or ● The financial condition of our insurers, which could increase our cost to obtain insurance, and/or make it difficult for or insurers to meet their obligations in the event we experience a loss due to an insured peril. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from May 2021 to May 2022, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) increased 8.5 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981. The CPI-U increased 4.1% and 3.3% from May 2022 to May 2023 and May 2023 to May 2024, respectively. Inflationary costs have increased our input costs, and if we are unable to pass these costs through to the customer it could have an adverse effect on our business. We hold significant cash balances in deposit accounts with deposits in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). In the event of a bank failure at an institution where we maintain deposits in excess of the FDIC- insured amount, we may lose such excess deposits. The loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us. We utilize intellectual property in our business. For example, we own the trademarks Farmhouse Eggs® , 4Grain®, Sunups® , and Sunny Meadow® . We produce and market Egg-Land’s Best® and Land O’ Lakes ® under license agreements with EB. We have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands. The loss or expiration of any intellectual property could enable our competitors to compete more effectively with us by allowing them to make and sell products substantially similar to those we offer. This could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell those products, thereby adversely affecting our operations. Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of June 1, 2024, we had $45.8 million of goodwill. While we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired, future goodwill impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period and our net worth. Events beyond our control such as extreme weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business. Fire, bioterrorism, pandemics, extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, water rights restrictions, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, decrease production or availability of feed ingredients, or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from overtopped or breached

CYBERSECURITY Risk Management and Strategy We understand the importance of cybersecurity and its role in the success of our Company. Our business operations depend on the effective use of our information systems in order to properly serve our customers, manage our business and track and report our financial results. Our technology operations consider risks from cybersecurity threats in the implementation and execution of our business processes. We have considered and assessed the risks from cybersecurity threats as part of our overall risk assessment process using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. In order to identify, assess and manage material risks arising from cybersecurity threats, we maintain internal resources to monitor and quickly respond to such threats. We perform vulnerability scans and penetration testing designed to test the effectiveness of our security practices. We engage third-party service providers to assist in the evaluation of our internal controls over our information systems through audit and consulting services to test the design and operational effectiveness of security controls. We continually monitor our systems to detect and identify cybersecurity threats. Prior to contracting with third-party vendors, we perform risk assessments of the vendors and require the vendors to manage cybersecurity risks to our business operations as well as notify us of any potential or known cybersecurity risks. We also require our employees to complete training programs to increase their awareness of and sensitivity to cybersecurity threats. These training programs include the identification of such threats and the proper responses to a potential breach of cybersecurity that aligns with our adopted processes. The Company has implemented a response process in the event of a cybersecurity incident through its crisis management plan. The process includes the cooperation of the information technology team and our management team to properly detect and respond to these incidents. These responses include determination of the potential impact and materiality of the incident, potential disclosure and litigation matters, and mitigation of actual or potential damage to our systems or reputation arising from the incident. An action plan is implemented to respond to any potential cybersecurity breach in order to continue to effectively serve our customers and conduct our operations with as little interruption as practicable. The information technology team reviews the response process on a regular basis to ensure that it is designed to be effective and to encompass current or new cybersecurity threats. As of July 23, 2024, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or that we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion about risks from cybersecurity threats. Governance The Board is responsible for the oversight of management’s process for identifying and mitigating risks related to cybersecurity threats. On a quarterly basis, the Director of Information Technology provides a report to the Audit Committee regarding ongoing processes to improve and update our current cybersecurity protocols, new cybersecurity threats, results of internal assessments, and any recent cybersecurity incidents. The Audit Committee will make the Board aware of any information it deems necessary or appropriate in order for the Board to effectively oversee the Company’s cybersecurity risk management and strategy. The Director of Information Technology and the team he manages are responsible for the operation and maintenance of our information systems, including the assessment, identification and management of risks from cybersecurity threats. Together, the Director of Information Technology and his team have over 150 years of experience in the information technology and security environment. Our Chief Financial Officer, to whom the Director of Information Technology reports, has served as Chief Financial Officer and a Board member since 2018 and has over 40 years of risk management experience.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Dividends Cal-Maine has a variable dividend policy adopted by its Board of Directors. Pursuant to the policy, Cal-Maine pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company will pay dividends to shareholders of record on the 65th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the last quarter for which a dividend was paid. Under the Company's Credit Facility, dividends are restricted to the amount permitted under the Company’s current dividend policy, and may not be paid if a default exists or will arise after giving effect to the dividend or if the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals less than $50 million. Stock Performance Graph The Company utilized the (i) Russell 2000 Total Return, and (ii) S&P Composite 1500 Food Products Industry Index to benchmark the Company’s total shareholder return.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISK FACTORS; FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, securities, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors . In addition, because the following discussion includes numerous forward -looking statements relating to our business, securities, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and to the information set forth in the section of Part I immediately preceding Item 1 above under the caption “ Forward-Looking Statements .” COMPANY OVERVIEW Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs. Our fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal years 2024 and 2022 included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2023 included 53 weeks. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States (“U.S”). In fiscal 2024, we sold approximately 1.15 billion dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 21% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock as of June 1, 2024 of approximately 39.9 million layers and 11.8 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. We sell most of our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, companies servicing independent supermarkets in the U.S., food service distributors, and egg product consumers throughout the majority of the U.S. The Company has one reportable operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. For further description of our business, refer to Part I. Item I. Business . ACQUISITIONS On September 30, 2023, we completed our 24th acquisition since 1989, when we acquired the assets of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc. (“Fassio”), related to its commercial shell egg production and processing business. Fassio owned and operated commercial shell egg production and processing facilities with a capacity at the time of acquisition of approximately 1.2 million laying hens, primarily cage-free, a feed mill, pullets, a fertilizer production and composting operation and land located in Erda, Utah, outside Salt Lake City. This acquisition provided us with an opportunity to expand our market presence in Utah and the western U.S., particularly for cage-free eggs. For a further description of this transaction, refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2 – Acquisition . In March 2024, we acquired a broiler processing plant, hatchery and feed mill in Dexter, Missouri that were closed by Tyson Foods, Inc. in 2023 and that we are remodeling and repurposing for use in shell egg and egg products production to enhance our supply and distribution capabilities for customers in Missouri and surrounding areas. In addition, subsequent to our fiscal 2024, we acquired substantially all the egg production and processing assets of ISE America, Inc. and certain of its affiliates. The acquired assets include commercial shell egg production and processing facilities with a capacity at the time of acquisition of approximately 4.7 million laying hens, including 1.0 million cage-free, and 1.2 million pullets, feed mills, approximately 4,000 acres of land, inventories and an egg products breaking facility. The acquired assets also include an extensive customer distribution network across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and production operations in Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and South Carolina. These production assets are our first in Maryland, New Jersey and Delaware. We believe this acquisition provides us with an opportunity to significantly enhance our market reach in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. For further description of this transaction, refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17 – Subsequent Events . During fiscal 2022, we acquired the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC (“Red River”), which owns and operates a specialty shell egg production complex that includes 1.7 million cage-free hens. HPAI Since the HPAI outbreaks in 2015, there were no reported significant outbreaks of HPAI in the commercial table egg layer flocks until the February – December 2022 time period. During this time, approximately 44.3 million commercial layers and pullets were depopulated resulting in significant pressure on the overall supply of eggs. Thereafter, there were no HPAI cases affecting commercial layers until November 2023. From November 2023 through the end of May 2024, approximately 32.8 million commercial laying hens and pullets were depopulated.

Thereafter, there were no HPAI cases affecting commercial layers until November 2023. From November 2023 through the end of May 2024, approximately 32.8 million commercial laying hens and pullets were depopulated. 26 During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, we experienced HPAI outbreaks within our facilities in Kansas and Texas, resulting in the depopulation of approximately 3.1 million laying hens and 577,000 pullets and the temporary cessation of operations at the facilities. Both locations have been cleared by the USDA to resume operations and we have begun to repopulate the flock. We have continued efforts to minimize disruption to our customers. We remain dedicated to robust biosecurity programs across our locations; however, no farm is immune from HPAI. HPAI is currently widespread in the wild bird population worldwide. The extent of possible future outbreaks, with heightened risk during the migration seasons, and more recent HPAI events, which have been directly linked to dairy cattle operations, cannot be predicted. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the human health risk to the U.S. public from the HPAI virus is considered to be low. Also, according to the USDA, HPAI cannot be transmitted through safely handled and properly cooked eggs. There is no known risk related to HPAI associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled. For additional information, refer to Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors .

Basic $ 5.70 $ 15.58 $ 2.73 Diluted $ 5.69 $ 15.52 $ 2.72 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 1.932 $ 2.622 $ 1.579 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 2.049 $ 3.115 $ 1.712 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.550 $ 0.676 $ 0.571 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including graded and non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. For fiscal 2023, net sales increased to $3.1 billion, gross profit to $1.2 billion and net income to $758.0 million. The increases primarily resulted from significantly higher average egg selling prices, primarily due to the reduction in egg supply caused by HPAI and higher grain and other input costs, as some of our egg sales prices are based on formulas related to our costs of production. Gross profit and net income increases were partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and increased processing, packaging and warehouse costs. The impact of HPAI continued throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 as prices continued to increase. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, the average UB southeastern large index price was 138.8% higher than the average price of the first three quarters in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 the average UB southeastern large index price decreased 13.8% to $2.163 from the same period in the prior year as the egg supply improved from the effects of HPAI. Conventional egg selling prices declined significantly during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Our dozens sold increased by 5.9% for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in specialty egg sales, with most of the increase due to an increase in cage-free eggs sold. Our feed costs per dozen produced increased to $0.676 in fiscal 2023, compared to $0.571 in fiscal 2022. For fiscal year 2023, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $6.57 per bushel for corn and $450 per ton for soybean meal, representing increases of 4.1% and 14.7%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2022. Supplies of corn and soybean meal remained tight relative to demand throughout fiscal 2023, as evidenced by a low stock-to-use ratio for corn, as a result of weather-related shortfalls in production and yields, ongoing supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine War and its impact on the export markets. Basis levels for corn and soybean meal, which impact our costs for these feed ingredients, ran significantly higher in fiscal 2023 in our areas of operation compared to our prior year fiscal year as a result of higher transportation and storage costs, adding to our expense. For fiscal 2024, net sales decreased to $2.3 billion, gross profit to $541.6 million and net income to $277.9 million. The decreases compared to fiscal 2023 are primarily a result of a decrease in average egg selling prices. The average UB southeastern large index price for fiscal 2024 decreased 34% compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease is due in large part to the recovery of the egg supply following the HPAI outbreaks during most of calendar year 2022. However, the resurgence of HPAI beginning in November 2023 resulted in the UB southeastern large index price being 9.1% higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Our dozens sold for fiscal 2024 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2023. We had an increase in production capacity with the acquisition of the commercial shell egg production and processing business of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc. during fiscal 2024, which was offset by the temporary decrease in production due to the HPAI outbreaks at our facilities. Our feed costs per dozen produced decreased to $0.550 in fiscal 2024, compared to $0.676 in fiscal 2023. For fiscal year 2024, the average CBOT daily market price was $4.76 per bushel for corn and $390 per ton for soybean meal, representing decreases of 27.5% and 13.4%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2023. Current indications for corn project an overall better stocks-to-use ratio implying potentially lower prices in the near term; however, as long as outside factors remain uncertain (including weather patterns and global supply chain disruptions), volatility could remain.

Net shell egg sales represented 96.2% and 96.1% of total net sales in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s shell egg offerings include specialty and conventional shell eggs. Specialty shell eggs include cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced. Conventional shell eggs sales represent all other shell egg sales not sold as specialty shell eggs. Shell egg sales classified as “Other” represent sales of miscellaneous byproducts and resale products included with our shell egg operations. The Company’s egg products offering include liquid and frozen egg products and hard -cooked eggs. The table below presents an analysis of our conventional and specialty shell egg sales (in thousands, except percentage data): June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 Total net sales $ 2,326,443 $ 3,146,217 Conventional $ 1,291,743 57.7 % $ 2,051,961 67.9 % Specialty 925,665 41.4 % 956,993 31.6 % Egg sales, net 2,217,408 99.1 % 3,008,954 99.5 % Other 20,026 0.9 % 14,993 0.5 % Net shell egg sales $ 2,237,434 100.0 % $ 3,023,947 100.0 % Dozens sold: Conventional 746,687 65.1 % 749,076 65.3 % Specialty 400,946 34.9 % 398,297 34.7 % Total dozens sold 1,147,633 100.0 % 1,147,373 100.0 % Net average selling price per dozen: Conventional $ 1.730 $ 2.739 Specialty $ 2.309 $ 2.403 All shell eggs $ 1.932 $ 2.622 Egg products sales: Egg products net sales $ 89,009 $ 122,270 Pounds sold 74,849 70,035 Net average selling price per pound $ 1.189 $ 1.746 Shell egg net sales - For fiscal 2024, shell egg net sales decreased $786.5 million compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the decrease in net average selling prices for conventional eggs, and to a lesser extent the decrease in the net average selling prices for specialty eggs. - For fiscal 2024, conventional egg sales decreased $760.2 million, or 37.0%, compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the decrease in conventional egg prices. Changes in price resulted in a $753.4 million decrease in net sales and changes in volume resulted in a $6.5 million decrease in net sales. - Conventional egg prices reached record highs in fiscal 2023 due to HPAI outbreaks experienced throughout calendar year 2022 as well seasonal demand during the winter holidays. Prices were lower in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023 as the U.S. egg supply started to recover from outbreaks of HPAI. There has been a resurgence of HPAI starting in November 2023, and continuing through the remainder of fiscal 2024, which increased prices due to supply constraints. However, prices in fiscal 2024 remained lower on average than fiscal 2023. - Specialty egg sales decreased $31.3 million, or 3.3%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in specialty egg prices partially offset by a 0.7% increase in the volume of specialty dozens sold. Changes in price resulted in a $37.7 million decrease in net sales and changes in volume resulted in a $6.4 million increase in net sales.

The table below presents an analysis of our conventional and specialty shell egg sales (in thousands, except percentage data): June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 Total net sales $ 2,326,443 $ 3,146,217 Conventional $ 1,291,743 57.7 % $ 2,051,961 67.9 % Specialty 925,665 41.4 % 956,993 31.6 % Egg sales, net 2,217,408 99.1 % 3,008,954 99.5 % Other 20,026 0.9 % 14,993 0.5 % Net shell egg sales $ 2,237,434 100.0 % $ 3,023,947 100.0 % Dozens sold: Conventional 746,687 65.1 % 749,076 65.3 % Specialty 400,946 34.9 % 398,297 34.7 % Total dozens sold 1,147,633 100.0 % 1,147,373 100.0 % Net average selling price per dozen: Conventional $ 1.730 $ 2.739 Specialty $ 2.309 $ 2.403 All shell eggs $ 1.932 $ 2.622 Egg products sales: Egg products net sales $ 89,009 $ 122,270 Pounds sold 74,849 70,035 Net average selling price per pound $ 1.189 $ 1.746 Shell egg net sales - For fiscal 2024, shell egg net sales decreased $786.5 million compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the decrease in net average selling prices for conventional eggs, and to a lesser extent the decrease in the net average selling prices for specialty eggs. - For fiscal 2024, conventional egg sales decreased $760.2 million, or 37.0%, compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to the decrease in conventional egg prices. Changes in price resulted in a $753.4 million decrease in net sales and changes in volume resulted in a $6.5 million decrease in net sales. - Conventional egg prices reached record highs in fiscal 2023 due to HPAI outbreaks experienced throughout calendar year 2022 as well seasonal demand during the winter holidays. Prices were lower in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period of fiscal 2023 as the U.S. egg supply started to recover from outbreaks of HPAI. There has been a resurgence of HPAI starting in November 2023, and continuing through the remainder of fiscal 2024, which increased prices due to supply constraints. However, prices in fiscal 2024 remained lower on average than fiscal 2023. - Specialty egg sales decreased $31.3 million, or 3.3%, for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to a 3.9% decrease in specialty egg prices partially offset by a 0.7% increase in the volume of specialty dozens sold. Changes in price resulted in a $37.7 million decrease in net sales and changes in volume resulted in a $6.4 million increase in net sales. 30 - Our dozens sold for fiscal 2024 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2023. We had an increase in production capacity with the acquisition of the commercial shell egg production and processing business of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc. during fiscal 2024, which was offset by the temporary decrease in production due to the HPAI outbreaks at our facilities. Egg products net sales - Egg products net sales decreased $33.3 million, or 27.2%, primarily due to a 31.9% selling price decrease compared to fiscal 2023, which had a $41.7 million negative impact on net sales. - Our egg products net average selling price decreased in fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023 as the supply of shell eggs used to produce egg products increased. COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs from outside sources, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility (including labor), hen amortization and other related farm production costs. The following table presents the key variables affecting our cost of sales (in thousands, except cost per dozen data): Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 % Change Cost of Sales: Farm production $ 987,861 $ 1,118,741 (11.7) % Processing, packaging, and warehouse 335,949 342,836 (2.0) Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) 380,200 379,777 0.1 Total shell eggs 1,704,010 1,841,354 (7.5) Egg products 80,862 108,406 (25.4) Total $ 1,784,872 $ 1,949,760 (8.5) % Farm production costs (per dozen produced) Feed $ 0.550 $ 0.676 (18.6) % Other $ 0.433 $ 0.396 9.3 % Total $ 0.983 $ 1.072 (8.3) % Outside egg purchases (average cost per dozen) $ 2.16 $ 3.02 (28.5) % Dozens produced 1,018,835 1,058,540 (3.8) % Percent produced to sold 88.8% 92.3% (3.8) % Farm Production - Feed costs per dozen produced decreased 18.6% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower feed ingredient prices. Basis levels for corn and soybean meal were lower in our areas of operation compared to our prior fiscal year. - For fiscal 2024, the average daily CBOT market price was $4.76 per bushel for corn and $390 per ton of soybean meal, representing decreases of 27.6% and 13.4%, respectively, as compared to the average daily CBOT prices for fiscal 2023. - Other farm production costs increased due to higher flock amortization and increased facility costs. Flock amortization increased primarily due to the increased capitalized value of our flocks. This is primarily due to the higher feeds costs in earlier periods incurred during the growing phase of the flocks.

Flock amortization increased primarily due to the increased capitalized value of our flocks. This is primarily due to the higher feeds costs in earlier periods incurred during the growing phase of the flocks. 31 - Facility costs increased due primarily to increased contract labor in response to labor shortages as well as higher depreciation expense primarily due to the completion of several large construction projects during fiscal 2024. Current indications for corn project an overall better stocks-to-use ratio implying potentially lower prices in the near term; however, as long as outside factors remain uncertain (including weather patterns and global supply chain disruptions), volatility could remain. Processing, packaging, and warehouse - Processing, packaging, and warehouse costs decreased primarily due to a 3.5% reduction in the volume of processed dozens, partially offset by higher processing costs. Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) - Costs in this category remained relatively flat as the average cost per dozen of outside egg purchases decreased 28.5% compared to fiscal 2023, offset by an increase of 29.2% in dozens purchased due to the loss of production primarily caused by HPAI outbreaks at our facilities. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 23.3% for fiscal 2024, compared to 38.0% for fiscal 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs, partially offset by the lower feed ingredients prices. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SGA”) expenses include costs of delivery, marketing, and other general and administrative expenses. Delivery expense includes contract trucking expense and all costs to maintain and operate our fleet of trucks to deliver products to customers including the related payroll expenses. Marketing expense includes franchise fees that are submitted to Eggland’s Best, Inc. to support the EB brand, brokerage and commission fees, and other general marketing expenses such as payroll expenses for our in-house sales team. Other general and administrative expenses include corporate payroll related expenses and other general corporate overhead costs. The following table presents an analysis of our SGA expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 $ Change % Change Delivery expense $ 72,742 $ 77,548 $ (4,806) (6.2) % Marketing expense 52,285 57,198 (4,913) (8.6) % Litigation loss contingency accrual 19,648 - 19,648 N.M. % Other general and administrative expenses 107,950 97,461 10,489 10.8 % Total $ 252,625 $ 232,207 $ 20,418 8.8 % N.M. - Not Meaningful Delivery expense - The decreased delivery expense is primarily due to a decrease in contract trucking expense and fuel costs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. 32 Other general and administrative expenses - The increase in other general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase of $5.5 million in the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the Fassio asset acquisition, and increased legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in accrued bonuses compared to the prior year. GAIN ON INVOLUNTARY CONVERSIONS For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded a gain of $23.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, due to recoveries under indemnity and insurance programs that exceeded the amortized book value of the covered assets and our direct costs. OPERATING INCOME As a result of the above, our operating income was $312.5 million for fiscal 2024 , compared to $967.7 million for fiscal 2023. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Total other income (expense) consists of items not directly charged to, or related to, operations such as interest income and expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, among other items. Patronage dividends are paid to us from our membership in the EB cooperative. The Company recorded interest income of $32.3 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $18.6 million in fiscal 2023, primarily due to significantly higher cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale balances and yields. We recorded interest expense of $549 thousand and $583 thousand in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily related to commitment fees on our Credit Facility described below. INCOME TAXES For the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, our pre-tax income was $360.0 million, compared to $998.6 million for fiscal 2023. Income tax expense of $83.7 million was recorded for fiscal 2024 with an effective tax rate of 23. 2%. For fiscal 2023, income tax expense was $241.8 million with an effective tax rate of 24.2%. Items causing our effective tax rate to differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% are state income taxes, certain federal tax credits and certain items included in income or loss for financial reporting purposes that are not included in taxable income or loss for income tax purposes, including tax exempt interest income, certain nondeductible expenses, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $1.6 million for fiscal 2024 compared to a $1.3 million net loss for fiscal 2023. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for fiscal 2024 was $277.9 million, or $5.70 per basic and $5.69 per diluted share, compared to $758.0 million, or $15.58 per basic and $15.52 per diluted share for fiscal 2023. Fiscal Year Ended June 3, 2023 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2022 The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 3, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022 can be found in Part II.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 33 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We aim to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity, particularly given the cyclical nature of our business. We believe a strong balance sheet supports our growth opportunities and stockholder returns. Our priorities for the use of cash in recent periods have included the payment of dividends pursuant to our variable dividend policy, inorganic growth through acquisitions of businesses, organic growth including construction and conversion of cage-free facilities and investment in value-added products, and maintenance capital expenditures. Working Capital and Current Ratio Our working capital at June 1, 2024 was $1.0 billion, compared to $942.2 million at June 3, 2023. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 5.5 at June 1, 2024 compared to 6.2 at June 3, 2023. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. The decrease in our current ratio is primarily due to the increase in total current liabilities, which increased by $45.0 million to $227.7 million at June 1, 2024, due to increases in income tax payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily resulting from the $19.6 million litigation loss contingency accrual recorded in fiscal 2024 . Due to seasonal factors described in Part I. Item I. Business – Seasonality , we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $451.4 million for fiscal 2024 compared with $863.0 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs, partially offset by the lower cost of feed ingredients. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For fiscal 2024, $412.6 million was used in investing activities, primarily due to the purchases of investment securities, the acquisition of the assets of Fassio Egg Farms, Inc., and purchases of property, plant and equipment compared to $375.1 million used in investing activities in the same period of fiscal 2023. Purchases of investment securities were 573.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared to 530.8 million in fiscal 2023. Sales and maturities of investment securities were $358.9 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $291.8 million for fiscal 2023. Purchases of property, plant and equipment were $147.1 million and $136.6 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily reflecting progress on our construction projects. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We paid dividends totaling $91.9 million and $252.3 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of June 1, 2024, cash decreased $54.9 million since June 3, 2023. Acquisition of ISE America, Inc. Assets Subsequent to our fiscal 2024 year-end, we acquired substantially all the assets of ISE America, Inc. and certain of its affiliates related to their commercial shell egg production and processing facilities. The purchase price was approximately $112 million and was funded with available cash on hand. For additional information, refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17 – Subsequent Events . Credit Facility We had no long-term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2024 and 2023. On November 15, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with a five-year term. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million. As of June 1, 2024, no amounts were borrowed under the Credit Facility. We have $4.7 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were issued under our Credit Facility for the benefit of certain insurance companies. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 10 – Credit Facility for further information regarding our long-term debt.

The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. The decrease in our current ratio is primarily due to the increase in total current liabilities, which increased by $45.0 million to $227.7 million at June 1, 2024, due to increases in income tax payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily resulting from the $19.6 million litigation loss contingency accrual recorded in fiscal 2024 . Due to seasonal factors described in Part I. Item I. Business – Seasonality , we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $451.4 million for fiscal 2024 compared with $863.0 million for fiscal 2023.

Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 10 – Credit Facility for further information regarding our long-term debt. 34 Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements for operating activities primarily consist of feed ingredients, processing, packaging and warehouse costs, employee related costs, and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be paid from our cash from operations and cash and investment securities on hand for at least the next 12 months. While volatile egg prices and feed ingredient costs, among other things, make long-term predictions difficult, we have substantial liquid assets and availability under our Credit Facility to fund future operating requirements. Our material cash requirements for capital expenditures consist primarily of our projects to increase our cage-free production capacity. We continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage with our customers in efforts to help them achieve their announced timelines for cage-free egg sales. The following table presents material construction projects approved as of June 1, 2024 (in thousands): Project(s) Type Projected Completion Projected Cost Spent as of June 1, 2024 Remaining Projected Cost Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses Fiscal 2025 86,837 81,757 5,080 Dexter, MO Renovations Fiscal 2025 10,944 771 10,173 Feed Mill Fiscal 2026 10,480 3,254 7,226 Solar Project Fiscal 2026 5,789 475 5,314 Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses Fiscal 2026 135,905 108,035 27,870 $ 249,955 $ 194,292 $ 55,663 As of June 1, 2024, we had $102.2 million of purchase obligations outstanding, of which $84.6 million are due within one year. Purchase obligations primarily include contractual agreements to purchase feed ingredients and commitments to make capital expenditures. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of the receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. We believe our current cash balances, investments, projected cash flows from operations, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next 12 months and to fund our capital commitments currently in place thereafter.

Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described below. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant judgment exists in valuing certain intangible assets and the most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the asset’s expected useful lives.

34 Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements for operating activities primarily consist of feed ingredients, processing, packaging and warehouse costs, employee related costs, and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be paid from our cash from operations and cash and investment securities on hand for at least the next 12 months. While volatile egg prices and feed ingredient costs, among other things, make long-term predictions difficult, we have substantial liquid assets and availability under our Credit Facility to fund future operating requirements. Our material cash requirements for capital expenditures consist primarily of our projects to increase our cage-free production capacity. We continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage with our customers in efforts to help them achieve their announced timelines for cage-free egg sales. The following table presents material construction projects approved as of June 1, 2024 (in thousands): Project(s) Type Projected Completion Projected Cost Spent as of June 1, 2024 Remaining Projected Cost Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses Fiscal 2025 86,837 81,757 5,080 Dexter, MO Renovations Fiscal 2025 10,944 771 10,173 Feed Mill Fiscal 2026 10,480 3,254 7,226 Solar Project Fiscal 2026 5,789 475 5,314 Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses Fiscal 2026 135,905 108,035 27,870 $ 249,955 $ 194,292 $ 55,663 As of June 1, 2024, we had $102.2 million of purchase obligations outstanding, of which $84.6 million are due within one year. Purchase obligations primarily include contractual agreements to purchase feed ingredients and commitments to make capital expenditures. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of the receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. We believe our current cash balances, investments, projected cash flows from operations, and available borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next 12 months and to fund our capital commitments currently in place thereafter.

The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant judgment exists in valuing certain intangible assets and the most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the asset’s expected useful lives. 35 The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities are generally determined internally and requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and significant judgment is required as management determines the fair market value for those assets. Due to inherent industry uncertainties including volatile egg prices and feed costs, unanticipated market changes, events, or circumstances may occur that could affect the estimates and assumptions used, which could result in subsequent impairments. INVENTORIES Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. If market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower, we record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value. The cost associated with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick purchases or hatching costs, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the hatching and growing periods of approximately 22 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s productive life, generally one to two years. Judgment exists in determining the flock’s productive life including factors such as laying rate and egg size, molt cycles, and customer demand. Furthermore, other factors such as hen type or weather conditions could affect the productive life. These factors could make our estimates of productive life differ from actual results. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss. GOODWILL As a result of acquiring businesses, the Company has $45.8 million of goodwill on June 1, 2024. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. The Company has determined that all of our locations share similar economic characteristics and support each other in the production of eggs and customer support. Therefore, we aggregate all our locations as a single reporting unit for testing goodwill for impairment. When the Company acquires a new location, we determine whether it should be integrated into our single reporting unit or treated as a separate reporting unit. Historically, we have concluded that acquired operations should be integrated into our single reporting unit due to the operational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant changes in management that occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing similar economic characteristics with the rest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes part of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it no longer represents the particular acquired operations that gave rise to the goodwill. We may conclude that a business acquired in the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately for goodwill impairment. At June 1, 2024, goodwill represented 2.1% of total assets and 2.5% of stockholders’ equity. Judgment exists in management’s evaluation of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg industry environment, cost inputs such as feed ingredients and overall financial performance. Furthermore, judgment exists in the evaluation of the threshold of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur that could negatively affect our operating conditions. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. During our annual impairment test which is the first day of the fourth quarter, we determined that goodwill passed the qualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary in fiscal 2024. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale.

REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. 36 Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivery the products. The Company periodically offers sales incentives or other programs such as rebates, discounts, coupons, volume-based incentives, guaranteed sales and other programs. The Company records an estimated allowance for costs associated with these programs, which is recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale using historical trends and projected redemption rates of each program. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and any difference between the estimated costs and actual realization of these programs would be recognized in the subsequent period. As the estimates noted above are based on historical information, we do not believe that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue. However, if actual results varied significantly from our estimates it could expose us to material gains or losses. LOSS CONTINGENCIES The Company evaluates whether a loss contingency exists, and if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. Except for the $19.6 million litigation loss contingency accrual in fiscal 2024, there were no loss contingency accruals for the past three fiscal years. Our evaluation of whether loss contingencies exist primarily relates to litigation matters. The outcome of litigation is uncertain due to, among other things, uncertainties regarding the facts will be established during the proceedings, uncertainties regarding how the law will be applied to the facts established, and uncertainties regarding the calculation of any potential damages or the costs of any potential injunctive relief. If the facts discovered or the Company’s assumptions change, future accruals for loss contingencies may be required. Results of operations may be materially affected by losses or a loss contingency accrual resulting from adverse legal proceedings. INCOME TAXES We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty exist with management’s application of tax regulations and evaluation of the more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax settlement could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and our results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of conventional eggs, which are subject to significant price fluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as conventional shell egg prices. Our exposure to market risk also includes changes in the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter into contracts for future purchases of corn and soybean meal, and as part of these contracts, we may lock-in the basis portion of our grain purchases several months in advance and commit to purchase organic ingredients to help assure supply. Ordinarily, we do not enter long-term contracts beyond a year to purchase corn and soybean meal or hedge against increases in the price of corn and soybean meal. The following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed costs per dozen as feed ingredient pricing varies: Change in price per bushel of corn $ (0.84) $ (0.56) $ (0.28) $ 0.00 $ 0.28 $ 0.56 $ 0.84 Change in price per ton soybean meal $ (76.50) 0.49 0.50 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 $ (51.00) 0.50 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 $ (25.50) 0.51 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 $ 0.00 0.52 0.53 0.54 0.55 (a) 0.56 0.57 0.58 $ 25.50 0.53 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 $ 51.00 0.54 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 0.60 $ 76.50 0.55 0.56 0.57 0.58 0.59 0.60 0.61

INTEREST RATE RISK We have a $250 million Credit Facility, borrowings under which would bear interest at variable rates. No amounts were outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK At June 1, 2024, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 8.5 months, and the composite credit rating of the holdings are A+ / A1 / A+ (S&P / Moody’s / Fitch). Generally speaking, rising interest rates decrease the value of fixed income securities portfolios. As of June 1, 2024, the estimated fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio was approximately $574.5 million and reflected unrealized losses of approximately $1.2 million. For additional information see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading “Investment Securities Available-for- Sale” and Note 3 – Investment Securities Available -for-Sale in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas, except that at June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, 26.8% and 30.1%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club). No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable at June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2024, and the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the Index at Items 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entities’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries either disclose the amount of a possible loss or range of loss

Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entities’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries either disclose the amount of a possible loss or range of loss 39 in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries disclose significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries believe there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We identified litigation and claims as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing management’s judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims.

(“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs, including conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free -range, pasture-raised and nutritionally-enhanced eggs. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells most of its shell eggs throughout the majority of the United States. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and of majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal years ending on June 1, 2024 and May 28, 2022 included 52 weeks and the fiscal year ended June 3, 2023 included 53 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain bank accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $ 250,000 . The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. Investment Securities Available-for-Sale The Company has determined that its debt securities are available-for-sale investments. We classify these securities as current because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available -for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and is recorded in interest income. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, reserves for credit losses were $ 490 thousand and $ 579 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based

Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, reserves for credit losses were $ 490 thousand and $ 579 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based 46 on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and credit history. Collateral is generally not required. The Company minimizes exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. In determining our reserve for credit losses, receivables are assigned an expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors. At June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, one customer accounted for approximately 26.8 % and 30.1 % of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively. Inventories Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The cost associated with flocks, consisting principally of chicks, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during a growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over the productive lives of the flocks, generally one to two years . As the amortization period of the flocks is relatively short, disclosure of the gross cost and accumulated amortization is omitted. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property, plant, and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The equity method of accounting is used when the Company can exert significant influence over an entity, but does not control its financial and operating decisions. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these entities. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values, when the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, are recorded at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes. Membership in cooperatives are recorded at cost, plus or minus any allocated equities and retains. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value in business acquisitions, which include franchise rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks and right of use intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Indefinite life assets are recorded at fair value in business acquisitions and represent water rights. They are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Accrued Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide coverage for the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. 47 Dividend Payable We accrue dividends at the end of each quarter according to the Company’s dividend policy adopted by its Board of Directors. The Company pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company pays dividends to shareholders of record on the 65th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the most recent quarter for which a dividend was paid. The dividend policy is subject to periodic review by the Board of Directors. Treasury Stock Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The grant of restricted stock through the Company’s share-based compensation plans is funded through the issuance of treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares in accordance with the Company’s share- based compensation plans are credited or charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value using the average-cost method. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue through sale of its products to customers through retail, foodservice and other distribution channels. The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from agreements or contracts with customers based upon the customer ordering its products with a single performance obligation of delivering the product. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. Costs paid to third party brokers to obtain agreements are expensed as the Company’s agreements are generally less than one year. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivery of the products. The Company periodically offers sales incentives or other programs such as rebates, discounts, coupons, volume-based incentives, guaranteed sales and other programs. The Company records an estimated allowance for costs associated with these programs, which is recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale using historical trends and projected redemption rates of each program. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and any difference between the estimated costs and actual realization of these programs would be recognized the subsequent period. Shipping and Distribution Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 72.7 million, $ 77.5 million, and $ 62.7 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s policy with respect to evaluating uncertain tax positions is based upon whether management believes it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained upon review by the taxing authorities. The tax positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company initially and subsequently measures the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company records interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Based upon management’s assessment, there are no uncertain tax positions expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 14 – Stock Compensation Plans for more information. Business Combinations The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. We determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities internally, which requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Gain on Involuntary Conversions The Company maintains insurance for both property damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic events, such as fires, hurricanes, tornadoes and other acts of God, and is eligible to participate in U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) indemnity and compensation programs for certain losses due to disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”). Specifically, the Animal Health Protection Act authorizes the USDA to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be destroyed during a disease response. Payments received under these programs are based on the fair market value of the poultry and/or eggs at the time that HPAI virus is detected in the flock. Other covered costs include feed, depopulation and disposal costs, and virus elimination costs. The USDA does not provide indemnity for income or production losses suffered due to downtime or other business disruptions nor for indirect continuing expenses. Recoveries received for property damage, business interruption and disease outbreaks in excess of the net book value of damaged assets, including poultry, clean-up and demolition costs, and other direct post-event costs are recorded within “Gain on involuntary conversions” in the period received or committed when all contingencies associated with the recoveries are resolved. Loss Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(“Fassio”), related to its commercial shell egg production and processing business. Fassio owned and operated commercial shell egg production and processing facilities with a capacity at the time of acquisition of approximately 1.2 million laying hens, primarily cage-free, a feed mill, pullets, a fertilizer production and composting operation and land located in Erda, Utah, outside Salt Lake City. The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for the Fassio assets and the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date (in thousands): Cash consideration paid $ 53,746 Fair value of contingent consideration 1,000 Total estimated purchase consideration 54,746 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Inventory $ 6,164 Property, plant and equipment 44,540 Intangible assets 2,272 Other long-term assets 143 Liabilities assumed ( 143 ) Total identifiable net assets 52,976 Goodwill 1,770 $ 54,746 Inventory consisted primarily of flock, feed ingredients, packaging, and egg inventory. Flock inventory was valued at carrying value as management believes that its carrying value best approximates its fair value. Feed ingredients, packaging and egg inventory were all valued based on market prices as of September 30, 2023. Property, plant and equipment were valued utilizing the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the assets and subtracting any depreciation resulting from physical deterioration and/or functional or economic obsolescence. Intangible assets consisted primarily of water rights within the property acquired. Water rights were valued using the sales comparison approach. Contingent consideration liability was recorded and represents potential future cash payment to the sellers contingent on the acquired business meeting certain return on profitability milestones over a three-year period, commencing on the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions and unobservable inputs that require significant judgement used in the estimate include weighted average cost of capital, egg prices, projected revenue and expenses over the period for which the contingent consideration is measured, and the probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving the forecasted projections. A range of potential outcomes cannot be reasonably estimated due to market volatility of egg prices. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the acquisition date fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill recorded in connection with the Fassio acquisition is primarily attributable to improved efficiencies from integrating the assets of Fassio with the operations of the Company. The Company recognized goodwill of $ 1.8 million as a result of the acquisition.

Other Postretirement Employee Benefits The Company maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan to provide limited health benefits to certain qualified retired employees and officers. Retired non-officers and spouses are eligible for coverage until attainment of Medicare eligibility, at which time coverage ceases. Retired officers and spouses are eligible for lifetime benefits under the plan. Officers, who retired prior to May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A and B. Officers, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. The plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”), whereby an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, this expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employees’ approximate period of employment. The liability associated with the plan was $ 2.6 million and $ 2.7 million at June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, respectively. The remaining disclosures associated with ASC 715 are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements. Effective March 1, 2023, the Company adopted a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) and a split dollar life insurance plan (“Split Dollar Plan”) designed to provide deferred compensation and a pre-retirement death benefit for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company. Provided the vesting conditions are met, participants in the SERP are eligible to receive an aggregate retirement benefit of $ 500,000 , which is paid in annual installments of $ 50,000 for 10 years . A participant becomes vested in the retirement benefit over five years of plan participation at 20 % per year. If a participant becomes disabled, attains the retirement age of 65, or the Company experiences a change in control, vesting will be accelerated to 100 %. If a participant dies while employed, he or she will not receive any benefits under the SERP, but their beneficiaries will instead be entitled to the life insurance benefit provided under the Split Dollar Plan, which is $500,000. The liability recorded for these plans was $ 298 thousand and $ 63 thousand at June 1, 2024 and June 3, 2023, respectively, and is classified within “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On May 26, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated November 15, 2021 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Amendment replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate interest rate benchmark with the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). The Credit Agreement has a five -year term. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or “Revolver”) in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 15 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 15 million sublimit for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting, with the consent of BMO Harris Bank N.A. (the “Administrative Agent”), an increase in the Credit Facility in the aggregate up to $ 200 million by adding one or more incremental senior secured term loans or increasing one or more times the revolving commitments under the Revolver.

No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of June 1, 2024 or June 3, 2023 or during fiscal 2024 or 56 fiscal 2023. The Company had $ 4.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility at June 1, 2024. The interest rate in connection with loans made under the Credit Facility is based on, at the Company’s election, either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Adjusted Term SOFR” means with respect to any tenor, the per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) Term SOFR as defined in the Credit Agreement plus (ii) 0.10 % (10 basis points); provided, if Adjusted Term SOFR determined as provided above shall ever be less than the Floor, then Adjusted Term SOFR shall be deemed to be the Floor. The “Floor” means the rate per annum of interest equal to 0.00 %. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one -month tenor plus 1.00 %. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for SOFR Loans, in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility payable quarterly from 0.15 % to 0.25 % in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly -owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement for the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested quarterly of no greater than 50 %; and (ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth at all times of $ 700 Million plus 50 % of net income (if net income is positive) less permitted restricted payments for each fiscal quarter after November 27, 2021. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr.’s spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100 % of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50 % of the Company's voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement. Further, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, payment of dividends under the Company's current dividend policy of one-third of the Company's net income computed in accordance with GAAP and payment of other dividends or repurchases by the Company of its capital stock is allowed, as long as after giving effect to such dividend payments or repurchases no default has occurred and is continuing and the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals at least $ 50 million. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due under the Credit Facility and foreclosure of the collateral securing the Credit Facility. At June 1, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility. Note 11 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”), holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company’s Restated Charter identifies family members of Mr. Adams (“Immediate Family Members”) and arrangements

56 fiscal 2023. The Company had $ 4.7 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility at June 1, 2024. The interest rate in connection with loans made under the Credit Facility is based on, at the Company’s election, either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Adjusted Term SOFR” means with respect to any tenor, the per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) Term SOFR as defined in the Credit Agreement plus (ii) 0.10 % (10 basis points); provided, if Adjusted Term SOFR determined as provided above shall ever be less than the Floor, then Adjusted Term SOFR shall be deemed to be the Floor. The “Floor” means the rate per annum of interest equal to 0.00 %. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one -month tenor plus 1.00 %. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for SOFR Loans, in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility payable quarterly from 0.15 % to 0.25 % in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly -owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement for the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested quarterly of no greater than 50 %; and (ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth at all times of $ 700 Million plus 50 % of net income (if net income is positive) less permitted restricted payments for each fiscal quarter after November 27, 2021. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr.’s spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100 % of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50 % of the Company's voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement. Further, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, payment of dividends under the Company's current dividend policy of one-third of the Company's net income computed in accordance with GAAP and payment of other dividends or repurchases by the Company of its capital stock is allowed, as long as after giving effect to such dividend payments or repurchases no default has occurred and is continuing and the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals at least $ 50 million. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due under the Credit Facility and foreclosure of the collateral securing the Credit Facility. At June 1, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility. Note 11 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”), holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company’s Restated Charter identifies family members of Mr. Adams (“Immediate Family Members”) and arrangements 57 and entities that are permitted to receive and hold shares of Class A Common Stock, with ten votes per share, without such shares converting into shares of Common Stock, with one vote per share (“Permitted Transferees”). The Permitted Transferees include arrangements and entities such as revocable trusts and limited liability companies that could hold Class A Common Stock for the benefit of Immediate Family Members. Each Permitted Transferee must have a relationship, specifically defined in the Restated Charter, with another Permitted Transferee or an Immediate Family Member. A share of Class A Common Stock transferred to a person other than a Permitted Transferee would automatically convert into Common Stock with one vote per share. Additionally, the Restated Charter includes a sunset provision pursuant to which all of the outstanding Class A Common Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock if: (a) less than 4,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees, or (b) if less than 4,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees. Note 12 - Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on the weighted average Common Stock and Class A Common Stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.

The Company’s shell egg product offerings include specialty and conventional shell eggs. Specialty shell eggs include cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced eggs. Conventional shell eggs sales represent all other shell egg sales not sold as specialty shell eggs. The Company’s egg products offering include liquid and frozen egg products and hard-cooked eggs. Liquid and frozen egg products are primarily sold to the institutional, foodservice and food manufacturing sectors. Hard-cooked eggs are sold primarily within the foodservice and retail channels. The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 13 Weeks Ended 14 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 June 1, 2024 June 3, 2023 Conventional shell egg sales $ 372,245 $ 395,433 $ 1,291,743 $ 2,051,961 Specialty shell egg sales 236,786 256,190 925,665 956,993 Egg products 25,015 33,996 89,009 122,270 Other 6,743 3,061 20,026 14,993 $ 640,789 $ 688,680 $ 2,326,443 $ 3,146,217 Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club) accounted for 34.0 %, 34.2 % and 29.5 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Note 14 - Stock Compensation Plans On October 2, 2020, shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 2012 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP Plan”). The purpose of the LTIP Plan is to assist us and our subsidiaries in attracting and retaining selected individuals who are expected to contribute to our long-term success. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for awards under the LTIP Plan is 2,000,000 of which 856,119 shares remain available for issuance, and may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. Awards may be granted under the LTIP Plan to any employee, any non- employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and any consultant who is a natural person and provides services to us or one of our subsidiaries (except for incentive stock options, which may be granted only to our employees). The only outstanding awards under the LTIP Plan are restricted stock awards. The restricted stock vests three years from the grant date, or upon death or disability, change in control, or retirement (subject to certain requirements). The restricted stock contains no other service or performance conditions. Restricted stock is awarded in the name of the recipient and, except for the right of disposal, constitutes issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock for all corporate purposes during the period of restriction including the right to receive dividends. Compensation expense is a fixed amount based on the grant date closing price and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Total stock-based compensation expense was $ 4.4 million, $ 4.2 million, and $ 4.1 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our unrecognized compensation expense as a result of non-vested shares was $ 7.5 million at June 1, 2024 and $ 7.2 million at June 3, 2023. The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized to stock compensation expense over a period of 2.1 years.

Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC On April 23, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary Wharton County Foods, LLC (“WCF”) were named as defendants in State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The State of Texas (the “State”) asserted claims based on the Company’s and WCF’s alleged violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices—Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 17.41-17.63 (“DTPA”). The State claimed that the Company and WCF offered shell eggs at excessive or exorbitant prices during the COVID-19 state of emergency and made misleading statements about shell egg prices. The State sought temporary and permanent injunctions against the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $ 100,000 in damages. On August 13, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the State’s original petition with prejudice. On September 11, 2020, the State filed a notice of appeal, which was assigned to the Texas Court of Appeals for the First District. On August 16, 2022, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. On October 31, 2022, the Company and WCF appealed the First District Court’s decision to the Supreme Court of Texas. On September 29, 2023, the Supreme Court of Texas denied the Company’s Petition for Review and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The district court entered a pre-trial order scheduling pre-trial proceedings and tentatively setting a trial date for August 11, 2025. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and, until a subsequent settlement was reached as described below, The Kellogg Company. On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs alleged that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs attacked certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, and on March 28, 2022, the court dismissed the Company with prejudice.

On December 1, 2023, the jury returned a decision awarding the Egg Products Plaintiffs $ 17.8 million in damages. If the jury’s decision is ultimately upheld, the defendants would be jointly and severally liable for treble damages, or $ 53.3 million, subject to credit for the Kellogg settlement described above and certain other settlements with previous settling defendants, plus the Egg Product Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees. This decision is not final and remains subject to the defendants’ motion for a directed verdict noted below and appeals by the parties. During our second fiscal quarter of 2024, we recorded an accrued expense of $ 19.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and classified as other noncurrent liabilities in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accrual represents our estimate of the Company’s proportional share of the reasonably possible ultimate damages award, excluding the Egg Product Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees that we believe would be approximately offset by the credits noted above. We have entered into a judgment allocation and joint defense agreement with the other major producer defendant remaining in the case, and are in discussions with other defendants regarding their contributions. Our accrual may change in the future based on the outcome of those discussions. Our accrual may also be revised in whole or in part in the future to the extent we are successful in further proceedings in the litigation. On November 29, 2023, the defendants, including the Company, filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law in their favor, known as a directed verdict, notwithstanding the jury’s decision. The court has not ruled on this motion. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend the claims asserted by the Egg Products Plaintiffs. State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc., Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc., George’s, Inc., Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc., and certain of their affiliates. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint sought injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages was dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed in or around 2005. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100 % of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. We also have a number of small contract producers that operate in the area. The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the State of Oklahoma, but no penalties were assessed. The court found the defendants liable for state law nuisance, federal common law nuisance, and state law trespass. The court also found the producers vicariously liable for the actions of their contract producers. The court directed the parties to confer in attempt to reach agreement on appropriate remedies. On June 12, 2023, the court ordered the parties to mediate before the retired Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha. On October 26, 2023, the parties filed separate status reports informing the court that the mediation was unsuccessful. Also on October 26, 2023, the defendants filed a post-trial motion to dismiss and supporting brief arguing that the case should be dismissed due to the state record before the court, the resulting mootness of the case, and violation of due process. On November 10, 2023, the State of Oklahoma filed its response in opposition to the motion to dismiss and on November 17, 2023, the defendants filed their reply. On June 26, 2024, the district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. While management believes there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss from the case, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: uncertainties inherent in any assessment of potential costs associated with injunctive relief or other penalties based on a decision in a case tried over 13 years ago based on environmental conditions that existed at the time, the lack of guidance from the court as to what might be considered appropriate remedies, the ongoing litigation with the State of Oklahoma and motion to dismiss before the court, and uncertainty regarding what our proportionate share of any remedy would be, although we believe that our share compared to the other defendants is small. Other Matters In addition to the above, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.

61 The trial of this case began on October 17, 2023. On December 1, 2023, the jury returned a decision awarding the Egg Products Plaintiffs $ 17.8 million in damages. If the jury’s decision is ultimately upheld, the defendants would be jointly and severally liable for treble damages, or $ 53.3 million, subject to credit for the Kellogg settlement described above and certain other settlements with previous settling defendants, plus the Egg Product Plaintiffs’ reasonable attorneys’ fees.

(b) Attestation Report of the Registrant’s Public Accounting Firm 64 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as June 1, 2024, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated July 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entities’ internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCOAB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting An entities’ internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entities’ internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entities; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entities are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entities; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entities’ assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Frost, PLLC Little Rock, Arkansas July 23, 2024
