19 ● Restricting the supply of energy sources or increasing our cost to procure energy; or ● Reducing the availability of feed ingredients, packaging material, and other raw materials, or increasing the cost of these items. Deterioration of economic conditions could also negatively impact: ● The financial condition of our suppliers, which may make it more difficult for them to supply raw materials; ● The financial condition of our customers, which may decrease demand for eggs or increase our bad debt expense; or ● The financial condition of our insurers, which could increase our cost to obtain insurance, and/or make it difficult for or insurers to meet their obligations in the event we experience a loss due to an insured peril. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from May 2021 to May 2022, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) increased 8.5 percent, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981. The CPI-U increased 4.1% from May 2022 to May 2023. Inflationary costs have increased our input costs, and if we are unable to pass these costs through to the customer it could have an adverse effect on our business. We hold significant cash balances in deposit accounts with deposits in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). In the event of a bank failure at an institution where we maintain deposits in excess of the FDIC- insured amount, we may lose such excess deposits. The loss of any registered trademark or other intellectual property could enable other companies to compete more effectively with us. We utilize intellectual property in our business. For example, we own the trademarks Farmhouse Eggs® , 4Grain®, Sunups® , and Sunny Meadow® . We produce and market Egg-Land’s Best® and Land O’ Lakes ® under license agreements with EB. We have invested a significant amount of money in establishing and promoting our trademarked brands. The loss or expiration of any intellectual property could enable our competitors to compete more effectively with us by allowing them to make and sell products substantially similar to those we offer. This could negatively impact our ability to produce and sell those products, thereby adversely affecting our operations. Impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our results of operations or net worth. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of business acquisitions over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of June 3, 2023, we had $44.0 million of goodwill. While we believe the current carrying value of this goodwill is not impaired, future goodwill impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period and our net worth. Events beyond our control such as extreme weather and natural disasters could negatively impact our business. Fire, bioterrorism, pandemics, extreme weather or natural disasters, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, water rights restrictions, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of our flocks, decrease production or availability of feed ingredients, or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, discharges from overtopped or breached wastewater treatment lagoons, damage to our production and processing facilities, labor shortages or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 20 ITEM 2.

Dividends Cal-Maine has a variable dividend policy adopted by its Board of Directors. Pursuant to the policy, Cal-Maine pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third 21 (1/3) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company will pay dividends to shareholders of record on the 65th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the last quarter for which a dividend was paid. Under the Company's Credit Facility, dividends are restricted to the amount permitted under the Company’s current dividend policy, and may not be paid if a default exists or will arise after giving effect to the dividend or if the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals less than $50 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISK FACTORS; FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, securities, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors . In addition, because the following discussion includes numerous forward -looking statements relating to our business, securities, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors and to the information set forth in the section of Part I immediately preceding Item 1 above under the caption “ Forward-Looking Statements .” COMPANY OVERVIEW Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs. Our fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal year 2023 and 2022 included 53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States (“U.S”). In fiscal 2023, we sold approximately 1,147.4 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 21% of domestic shell egg consumptio n. Our total flock as of June 3, 2023 of approximately 41.2 million layers and 10.8 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. We sell most of our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, companies servicing independent supermarkets in the U.S., food service distributors, and egg product consumers in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. The Company has one reportable operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products. We classify cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised and nutritionally enhanced as specialty eggs for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as conventional eggs. While we report separate sales information for these types of eggs, there are a number of cost factors which are not specifically available for conventional or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. For further description of our business, refer to Part I. Item I. Business . HPAI Since the first detection in a U.S. commercial flock in February 2022, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) continued to occur in U.S. poultry flocks throughout calendar year 2022 and, less frequently, in calendar year 2023, which is more than twice the length of time of the last HPAI outbreak in 2014-2015. HPAI affected more than 58 million birds in 47 states and resulted in the depopulation of 43.3 million commercial layer hens and 1.0 million pullets leading to higher prices for conventional shell eggs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and continuing through the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Though the virus is still present, due to seasonal migratory patterns of wild birds (which serve as carriers for the disease) the rate of outbreaks has substantially decreased and the last occurrence in a commercial egg laying flock was in December 2022. The USDA attributes this, in large part, to improved biosecurity measures by the commercial poultry industry. The industry and USDA have devoted significant resources to attempt to prevent future outbreaks. With the spring wild bird migration complete in the U.S., focus is on the fall migration season. We believe the HPAI outbreak will continue to impact the overall supply of eggs until the layer hen flock is fully replenished. The egg industry typically experiences lower sales during the summer. The layer hen flock five-year average from 2020-2022 for the month of June is 321.5 million hens. According to the USDA the U.S. flock consisted of 317.4 million layers producing table or market type eggs as of July 1, 2023, which is 0.9% below the five-year average and reflects efforts by U.S. producers to repopulate their flocks. As the layer flock began to recover in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, prices for conventional shell eggs decreased from previous highs. There have been no positive tests for HPAI at any Cal-Maine Foods’ owned or contracted production facility as of July 25, 2023. While no farm is immune from HPAI, we believe we have implemented and continue to maintain robust biosecurity programs across our locations. We are also working closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of this and future outbreaks and effectively manage our response, if needed.

Basic $ 15.58 $ 2.73 $ 0.04 Diluted $ 15.52 $ 2.72 $ 0.04 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 2.622 $ 1.579 $ 1.217 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 3.115 $ 1.712 $ 1.155 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.676 $ 0.571 $ 0.446 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. For fiscal 2022, net sales increased to $1.8 billion, gross profit to $337.1 million and net income to $132.7 million from fiscal 2021 net sales of $1.3 billion, gross profit of $160.7 million and net income of $2.1 million. The increases resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as an increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by a decline in the volume of conventional eggs sold. Gross profit and net income increases were partially offset by increased cost of feed ingredients and increased processing costs. Consumer demand maintained a steady growth throughout our first three quarters of fiscal 2021 but began trending down during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers started to resume pre-pandemic activities. We believe the decreased demand in foodservice seen throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell eggs for fiscal 2021 in the retail market due to the extra supply entering the retail channel from the foodservice channel. For fiscal 2022, we believe prices for conventional eggs were positively impacted by a better alignment of the size of the conventional production layer hen flock and customer and consumer demand through the first three fiscal quarters of 2022. Conventional egg prices further increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreased supply caused by the HPAI outbreak compounded with good customer demand. Throughout fiscal 2022 the hen numbers reported by the USDA remained below the five-year average. For fiscal 2023, net sales increased to $3.1 billion, gross profit to $1.2 billion and net income to $758.0 million. The increases primarily resulted from significantly higher average egg selling prices, primarily due to the reduction in egg supply caused by HPAI and higher grain and other input costs, as some of our egg sales prices are based on formulas related to our costs of production. Gross profit and net income increases were partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and increased processing, packaging and warehouse costs. The impact of HPAI continued throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 as prices continued to increase. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, the average UB southeastern large index price was 138.8% higher than the average price of the first three quarters in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 the average UB southeastern large index price decreased 13.8% to $2.163 from the same period in the prior year as the egg supply improved from the effects of HPAI. Conventional egg selling prices declined significantly during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Our dozens sold increased by 5.9% for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in specialty egg sales. According to Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), for the 52 weeks ended June 4, 2023, which approximately aligns with our fiscal year 2023, conventional egg dozens sold in the U.S. at multi-retail outlets decreased 9.3%, while specialty egg dozens sold increased 9.9% versus the prior-year comparable period. Our conventional eggs dozens sold increased 0.2% and specialty egg dozens sold increased 18.6% as compared to fiscal 2022, with most of the increase due to an increase in cage-free eggs sold. Our feed costs per dozen produced increased to $0.676 in fiscal 2023, compared to $0.571 in fiscal 2022. For fiscal year 2023, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $6.57 per bushel for corn and $450 per ton for soybean meal, representing increases of 4.1% and 14.7%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2022. Supplies of corn and soybean meal remained tight relative to demand in throughout fiscal 2023, as evidenced by a low stock-to- use ratio for corn, as a result of weather-related shortfalls in production and yields, ongoing supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine War and its impact on the export markets.

24 Executive Overview of Results – Fiscal Years Ended June 3, 2023, May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021 Fiscal Years Ended June 3, 2023 May 28, 2022 May 29, 2021 Net sales (in thousands) $ 3,146,217 $ 1,777,159 $ 1,348,987 Gross profit (in thousands) $ 1,196,457 $ 337,059 $ 160,661 Net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. $ 758,024 $ 132,650 $ 2,060 Net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. Basic $ 15.58 $ 2.73 $ 0.04 Diluted $ 15.52 $ 2.72 $ 0.04 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 2.622 $ 1.579 $ 1.217 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 3.115 $ 1.712 $ 1.155 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.676 $ 0.571 $ 0.446 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. For fiscal 2022, net sales increased to $1.8 billion, gross profit to $337.1 million and net income to $132.7 million from fiscal 2021 net sales of $1.3 billion, gross profit of $160.7 million and net income of $2.1 million. The increases resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as an increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by a decline in the volume of conventional eggs sold. Gross profit and net income increases were partially offset by increased cost of feed ingredients and increased processing costs. Consumer demand maintained a steady growth throughout our first three quarters of fiscal 2021 but began trending down during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers started to resume pre-pandemic activities. We believe the decreased demand in foodservice seen throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell eggs for fiscal 2021 in the retail market due to the extra supply entering the retail channel from the foodservice channel. For fiscal 2022, we believe prices for conventional eggs were positively impacted by a better alignment of the size of the conventional production layer hen flock and customer and consumer demand through the first three fiscal quarters of 2022. Conventional egg prices further increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreased supply caused by the HPAI outbreak compounded with good customer demand. Throughout fiscal 2022 the hen numbers reported by the USDA remained below the five-year average. For fiscal 2023, net sales increased to $3.1 billion, gross profit to $1.2 billion and net income to $758.0 million. The increases primarily resulted from significantly higher average egg selling prices, primarily due to the reduction in egg supply caused by HPAI and higher grain and other input costs, as some of our egg sales prices are based on formulas related to our costs of production. Gross profit and net income increases were partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and increased processing, packaging and warehouse costs. The impact of HPAI continued throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 as prices continued to increase. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, the average UB southeastern large index price was 138.8% higher than the average price of the first three quarters in fiscal 2022. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 the average UB southeastern large index price decreased 13.8% to $2.163 from the same period in the prior year as the egg supply improved from the effects of HPAI. Conventional egg selling prices declined significantly during the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Our dozens sold increased by 5.9% for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an increase in specialty egg sales. According to Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), for the 52 weeks ended June 4, 2023, which approximately aligns with our fiscal year 2023, conventional egg dozens sold in the U.S. at multi-retail outlets decreased 9.3%, while specialty egg dozens sold increased 9.9% versus the prior-year comparable period. Our conventional eggs dozens sold increased 0.2% and specialty egg dozens sold increased 18.6% as compared to fiscal 2022, with most of the increase due to an increase in cage-free eggs sold. Our feed costs per dozen produced increased to $0.676 in fiscal 2023, compared to $0.571 in fiscal 2022. For fiscal year 2023, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $6.57 per bushel for corn and $450 per ton for soybean meal, representing increases of 4.1% and 14.7%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2022. Supplies of corn and soybean meal remained tight relative to demand in throughout fiscal 2023, as evidenced by a low stock-to- use ratio for corn, as a result of weather-related shortfalls in production and yields, ongoing supply chain disruptions and the Russia-Ukraine War and its impact on the export markets. Basis levels for corn and soybean meal, which impact our costs for 25 these feed ingredients, ran significantly higher in fiscal 2023 in our areas of operation compared to our prior year fiscal year as a result of higher transportation and storage costs, adding to our expense.

Net shell egg sales represented 96.1% and 96.6% of total net sales for the fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. Shell egg sales classified as “Other” represent sales of miscellaneous byproducts and resale products included with our shell egg operations. The table below presents an analysis of our conventional and specialty shell egg sales (in thousands, except percentage data): June 03, 2023 May 28, 2022 Total net sales $ 3,146,217 $ 1,777,159 Conventional $ 2,051,961 67.9 % $ 1,061,995 61.8 % Specialty 956,993 31.6 % 648,838 37.8 % Egg sales, net 3,008,954 99.5 % 1,710,833 99.6 % Other 14,993 0.5 % 6,322 0.4 % Net shell egg sales $ 3,023,947 100.0 % $ 1,717,155 100.0 % Dozens sold: Conventional 749,076 65.3 % 747,914 69.0 % Specialty 398,297 34.7 % 335,875 31.0 % Total dozens sold 1,147,373 100.0 % 1,083,789 100.0 % Net average selling price per dozen: Conventional $ 2.739 $ 1.420 Specialty $ 2.403 $ 1.932 All shell eggs $ 2.622 $ 1.579 Egg products sales: Egg products net sales $ 122,270 $ 60,004 Pounds sold 70,035 63,968 Net average selling price per pound $ 1.746 $ 0.938 Shell egg net sales - For fiscal 2023, shell egg net sales increased $1.3 billion, primarily due to higher net average selling prices for conventional eggs, and to a lesser extent specialty eggs. - For fiscal 202 3, conventional egg sales increased $990.0 million, or 93.2%, compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the increase in conventional egg prices. Changes in price resulted in a $988.0 million increase and changes in volume resulted in a $1.7 million increase in net sales. - Conventional egg prices increased in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 primarily due to decreased supply caused by the HPAI outbreak, discussed above. Conventional egg prices decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to average fiscal 2023 levels, due to an increased supply of conventional eggs caused by the repopulating of layer flocks in response to the impact of HPAI and typical seasonal decreases in demand. Conventional egg prices exceeded specialty egg prices during fiscal 2022 and for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, which is atypical historically. Conventional egg prices generally respond more quickly to market conditions because we sell the majority of our conventional shell eggs based on formulas that adjust periodically and take into account, in varying ways, independently quoted regional wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production. The majority of our specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers and therefore do not fluctuate as much as conventional pricing. - Specialty egg sales increased $308.2 million, or 47.5%, for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to a 24.4% increase in specialty egg prices and a 18.6% increase in the volume of specialty dozens sold. Changes in price resulted in a $187.6 million increase and change in volume resulted in a $120.6 million increase in net sales, respectively. Our

Changes in price resulted in a $187.6 million increase and change in volume resulted in a $120.6 million increase in net sales, respectively. Our 27 specialty egg sales also benefitted from our additional cage-free production capacity. Cage-free revenue for fiscal 2023 was 20.2% of total revenue, compared to 22.3% for fiscal 2022. - Net average selling prices of specialty eggs increased by agreements with our customers in response to rising feed and other input costs as well as lower supply availability due to HPAI. - Demand for specialty eggs increased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 as conventional egg prices rose. Our sales volume benefited versus the prior-year period, through use of our higher cage-free production capacity. Egg products net sales - Egg products net sales increased $62.3 million or 103.8%, primarily due to an 86.1% selling price increase compared to fiscal 2022, which had a $56.6 million positive impact on net sales. - Our egg products net average selling price increased in fiscal 2023, compared to fiscal 2022 as the supply of shell eggs used to produce egg products decreased due to the HPAI outbreak that started in February 2022. COST OF SALES Cost of sales for fiscal 2023 were $1.9 billion compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2022. Cost of sales consists of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs from outside sources, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization and other related farm production costs.

Basis levels for corn and soybean meal ran significantly higher in our areas of operation compared to our prior fiscal year due to higher transportation and storage costs, adding to our expense. - For fiscal 2023, the average daily CBOT market price was $6.57 per bushel for corn and $450 per ton of soybean meal, representing increases of 4.1% and 14.7%, respectively, as compared to the average daily CBOT prices for fiscal 2022. 28 - Other farm production costs increased due to higher facility and flock amortization. Facility costs increased due primarily to increased labor costs. Labor costs increased 29.6% due to increased use of contract labor and increased wages raised in response to labor shortages. - Flock amortization increased primarily from higher capitalized feed costs as well as higher amortization costs from an increase in our cage-free production. Supplies of corn and soybean remained tight relative to demand throughout fiscal 2023, as evidenced by a low stock-to-use ratio for corn, as a result of weather-related shortfalls in production and yields, ongoing supply chain disruptions and the Russia- Ukraine War and its impact on the export markets. For fiscal 2024, we expect continued corn and soybean upward pricing pressures and further market volatility to affect feed costs. Processing, packaging, and warehouse - Cost of packaging materials increased 18.6% compared to fiscal 2022 as costs increased due to rising inflation and labor costs. - Labor costs increased 13.6% due to wage increases instituted in response to labor shortages and rising inflation. - Dozens processed increased 3.6% compared to fiscal 2022, which resulted in an $11.2 million increase in costs. Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) - Costs in this category increased 120.8% compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the increase in egg prices. The average price of outside egg purchases increased 75.6% per dozen compared to fiscal 2022. Additionally, our percentage of produced to sold decreased to 92.3% in fiscal 2023 from 94.3% in fiscal 2022 as we increased our volume of outside egg purchases in order to meet customer demand. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 38.0% for fiscal 2023 , compared to 19.0% for fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and processing, packaging and warehouse costs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative (“SGA”) expenses include costs of marketing, distribution, accounting, and corporate overhead. SG&A expenses increased $33.6 million to $232.2 million in fiscal 2023. The following table presents an analysis of our SGA expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended June 03, 2023 May 28, 2022 $ Change % Change Specialty egg expense $ 57,758 $ 59,830 $ (2,072) (3.5) % Delivery expense 77,548 62,677 14,871 23.7 % Payroll, taxes and benefits 57,830 43,954 13,876 31.6 % Stock compensation expense 4,205 4,063 142 3.5 % Other expenses 34,866 28,107 6,759 24.0 % Total $ 232,207 $ 198,631 $ 33,576 16.9 % Specialty egg expense - Specialty egg expense, which includes franchise fees, advertising and promotion costs generally tracks with specialty egg volumes, which were up 18.6% for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. However, our specialty egg expense decreased 3.5%, primarily due to a significant reduction in advertising costs. The higher prices for conventional eggs and the comparatively lower prices for specialty eggs diminished the need to promote specialty eggs in fiscal 2023. However, we anticipate that the need to promote specialty eggs will increase in fiscal 2024 as the market recovers from the effects of HPAI.

However, we anticipate that the need to promote specialty eggs will increase in fiscal 2024 as the market recovers from the effects of HPAI. 29 Delivery expense - The increased delivery expense is primarily due to the increase in fuel and labor costs for both our fleet and contract trucking. Compared to fiscal 2022, contract trucking and labor expenses increased approximately $10.2 million for fiscal 2023. Payroll, taxes and benefits expense - The increase in payroll, taxes and benefits expense is primarily due to an increase in the accrual for anticipated performance-based bonuses. Other expenses - The increase in other expenses is due to increased legal expenses of approximately $3.6 million as well as inflationary pressure increasing costs. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) As a result of the above, our operating income was $967.7 million for fiscal 2023 , compared to $143.5 million for fiscal 2022. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Total other income (expense) consists of items not directly charged to, or related to, operations such as interest income and expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, among other items. The Company recorded interest income of $18.6 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $988 thousand in fiscal 2022, primarily due to significantly higher cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale balances and yields. We recorded interest expense of $583 thousand and $403 thousand in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to commitment fees on our Credit Facility described below. Equity in income from unconsolidated entities for fiscal 2023 was $746 thousand compared to $1.9 million for fiscal 2022. Other, net for fiscal 2023 was income of $1.9 million compared to $9.8 million for fiscal 2022. The majority of the decrease is due to our acquisition in fiscal 2022 of the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC (“Red River”) as we recognized a $4.5 million gain in fiscal 2022 due to the remeasurement of our equity investment. We also received $1.4 million in fiscal 2022 related to our review and adjustment of our various marketing agreements. Additionally, the Company recorded a $2 million impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated entity in fiscal 2023. INCOME TAXES For the fiscal year ended June 3, 2023, our pre-tax income was $998.6 million, compared to $166.0 million for fiscal 2022. Income tax expense of $241.8 million was recorded for fiscal 2023 with an effective tax rate of 24.2%. For fiscal 2022, income tax expense was $33.6 million with an effective tax rate of 20.2%. Included in fiscal 2022 income tax expense is the discrete tax benefit of $8.3 million discussed in Note 2 – Acquisition of Part II. Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Excluding the discrete tax benefit, income tax expense was $41.9 million with an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.2%. At June 3, 2023, the Company had an income tax receivable of $67.0 million compared to $42.1 million at May 28, 2022. During fiscal 2022, the Company filed federal carryback tax returns for fiscal 2020 and 2021 taxable net operating losses to recover a portion of taxes paid in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. Subsequent to fiscal 2023, we received $31.8 million of the $34.9 million fiscal 2021 refund and believe we will receive the remaining amount of the fiscal 2020 and 2021 refunds, totaling $11.7 million, during our second fiscal quarter of 2024. An additional $23.5 million income tax receivable was recorded as of June 3, 2023 for fiscal 2023 federal overpayments in excess of federal tax liability. Items causing our effective tax rate to differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% are state income taxes, certain federal tax credits and certain items included in income or loss for financial reporting purposes that are not included in taxable income or loss for income tax purposes, including tax exempt interest income, certain nondeductible expenses, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest.

29 Delivery expense - The increased delivery expense is primarily due to the increase in fuel and labor costs for both our fleet and contract trucking. Compared to fiscal 2022, contract trucking and labor expenses increased approximately $10.2 million for fiscal 2023. Payroll, taxes and benefits expense - The increase in payroll, taxes and benefits expense is primarily due to an increase in the accrual for anticipated performance-based bonuses. Other expenses - The increase in other expenses is due to increased legal expenses of approximately $3.6 million as well as inflationary pressure increasing costs. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) As a result of the above, our operating income was $967.7 million for fiscal 2023 , compared to $143.5 million for fiscal 2022. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Total other income (expense) consists of items not directly charged to, or related to, operations such as interest income and expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, among other items.

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for fiscal 2023 was $758.0 million, or $15.58 per basic and $15.52 per diluted share, compared to $132.7 million, or $2.73 per basic and $2.72 per diluted share for fiscal 2022. Fiscal Year Ended May 28, 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 29, 2021 The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021 can be found in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company’s fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working Capital and Current Ratio Our working capital at June 3, 2023 was $942.2 million, compared to $476.8 million at May 28, 2022. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 6.16 at June 3, 2023 compared to 3.58 at May 28, 2022. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. The increase in our working capital and current ratio is primarily due to the increase in total current assets, which increased by $463.4 million to $1.1 billion at June 3, 2023, due to significant increases in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available -for-sale. Due to seasonal factors described in Part I. Item I. Business – Seasonality , we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $863.0 million for fiscal year 2023 compared with $126.2 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from higher selling prices for conventional eggs as well as the increased volume of specialty eggs sold, partially offset by the increased cost of feed ingredients and processing, packaging and warehouse costs. Cash Flows from Investing Activities We continue to invest in our facilities, with $136.6 million used to purchase property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2023, compared to $72.4 million in fiscal 2022. These investments were primarily made to expand our cage-free production capacity. We have for many years invested substantial amounts to expand our cage-free production capacity and expect to continue to do so. Purchases of investments were $530.8 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $98.2 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in purchases of investment securities is primarily due to the utilization of increased liquidity resulting from increased cash flows provided by operating activities noted above. Sales and maturities of investment securities were $291.8 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $92.7 million for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we also acquired the remaining 50% membership interest in Red River for $44.8 million, net of cash acquired. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We paid dividends totaling $252.3 million and $6.1 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 3, 2023, cash increased $233.7 million since May 28, 2022, compared to an increase of $1.7 million during fiscal 2022. Credit Facility We had no long-term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022. On November 15, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended the “Credit Agreement”) with a five-year term. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $250 million. As of June 3, 2023, no amounts were borrowed under the Credit Facility. We have $4.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were issued under our Credit Facility for the benefit of certain insurance companies. In May 2023, we entered into

30 NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $1.3 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a $209 thousand net loss for fiscal 2022. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. for fiscal 2023 was $758.0 million, or $15.58 per basic and $15.52 per diluted share, compared to $132.7 million, or $2.73 per basic and $2.72 per diluted share for fiscal 2022.

In May 2023, we entered into 31 an amendment to the Credit Agreement to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate interest rate benchmark. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 10 – Credit Facility for further information regarding our long-term debt. Material Cash Requirements Material cash requirements for operating activities primarily consist of feed ingredients, processing, packaging and warehouse costs, employee related costs, and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be paid from our cash from operations and cash and investment securities on hand for at least the next 12 months. While volatile egg prices and feed ingredient costs, among other things, make long-term predictions difficult, we have substantial liquid assets and availability under our Credit Facility to fund future operating requirements. Our material cash requirements for capital expenditures consist primarily of our projects to increase our cage-free production capacity. We continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage with our customers in efforts to help them achieve their announced timelines for cage-free egg sales.

Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described below. 32 BUSINESS COMBINATION S The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant judgment exists in valuing certain intangible assets. and the most significant assumptions requiring judgment involve estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the asset’s expected useful lives. The fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities are determined internally and requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and significant judgment is required as management determines the fair market value for those assets. Due to inherent industry uncertainties including volatile egg prices and feed costs, unanticipated market changes, events, or circumstances may occur that could affect the estimates and assumptions used, which could result in subsequent impairments. INVENTORIES Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. If market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower, we record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value. The cost associated with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s productive life, generally one to two years. Judgment exists in determining the flock’s productive life including factors such as laying rate and egg size, molt cycles, and customer demand. Furthermore, other factors such as hen type or weather conditions could affect the productive life. These factors could make our estimates of productive life differ from actual results. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss. GOODWILL As a result of acquiring businesses, the Company has $44.0 million of goodwill on June 3, 2023. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. The Company has determined that all of our locations share similar economic characteristics and support each other in the production of eggs and customer support. Therefore, we aggregate all our locations as a single reporting unit for testing goodwill for impairment. When the Company acquires a new location, we determine whether it should be integrated into our single reporting unit or treated as a separate reporting unit. Historically, we have concluded that acquired operations should be integrated into our single reporting unit due to the operational changes, redistribution of customers, and significant changes in management that occur when we acquire businesses, which result in the acquired operations sharing similar economic characteristics with the rest of our locations. Once goodwill associated with acquired operations becomes part of goodwill of our single reporting unit, it no longer represents the particular acquired operations that gave rise to the goodwill. We may conclude that a business acquired in the future should be treated as a separate reporting unit, in which case it would be tested separately for goodwill impairment. At June 3, 2023, goodwill represented 2.3% of total assets and 2.7% of stockholders’ equity. Judgment exists in management’s evaluation of the qualitative factors which include macroeconomic conditions, the current egg industry environment, cost inputs such as feed ingredients and overall financial performance. Furthermore, judgment exists in the evaluation of the threshold of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Uncertainty exists due to uncontrollable events that could occur that could negatively affect our operating conditions. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we elected to change the date of our annual impairment assessment from year-end to the first day of the fourth quarter. The change was made to more closely align the impairment assessment date with our annual planning

The change in impairment assessment date did not have any impact on goodwill or the impairment of goodwill. The change has been applied prospectively and will not have an impact on a retrospective basis. During our annual impairment test in fiscal 2023, we determined that goodwill passed the qualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 13 – Revenue Recognition in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ As the estimates noted above are based on historical information, we do not believe that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used to recognize revenue. However, if actual results varied significantly from our estimates it could expose us to material gains or losses. LOSS CONTINGENCIES The Company evaluates whether a loss contingency exists, and if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. There were no loss contingency reserves for the past three fiscal years. Our evaluation of whether loss contingencies exist primarily relates to litigation matters. The outcome of litigation is uncertain due to, among other things, uncertainties regarding the facts will be established during the proceedings, uncertainties regarding how the law will be applied to the facts established, and uncertainties regarding the calculation of any potential damages or the costs of any potential injunctive relief. If the facts discovered or the Company’s assumptions change, future reserves for loss contingencies may be required. Results of operations may be materially affected by losses or a loss contingency reserve resulting from adverse legal proceedings. INCOME TAXES We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Judgment and uncertainty exist with management’s application of tax regulations and evaluation of the more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. An adverse tax settlement could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and our results of operations.

33 and forecasting process. The change in impairment assessment date did not have any impact on goodwill or the impairment of goodwill. The change has been applied prospectively and will not have an impact on a retrospective basis. During our annual impairment test in fiscal 2023, we determined that goodwill passed the qualitative assessment and therefore no quantitative analysis of goodwill impairment was necessary. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 13 – Revenue Recognition in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of conventional eggs, which are subject to significant price fluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as conventional shell egg prices. Our exposure to market risk also includes changes in the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter into contracts for future purchases of corn and soybean meal, and as part of these contracts, we may lock-in the basis portion of our grain purchases several months in advance and commit to purchase organic ingredients to help assure supply. Ordinarily, we do not enter long-term contracts beyond a year to purchase corn and soybean meal or hedge against increases in the price of corn and soybean meal. The following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed costs per dozen as feed ingredient pricing varies: Change in price per bushel of corn $ (0.84) $ (0.56) $ (0.28) $ 0.00 $ 0.28 $ 0.56 $ 0.84 Change in price per ton soybean meal $ (76.50) 0.616 0.626 0.636 0.646 0.656 0.666 0.676 $ (51.00) 0.626 0.636 0.646 0.656 0.666 0.676 0.686 $ (25.50) 0.636 0.646 0.656 0.666 0.676 0.686 0.696 $ 0.00 0.646 0.656 0.666 0.676 (a) 0.686 0.696 0.706 $ 25.50 0.656 0.666 0.676 0.686 0.696 0.706 0.716 $ 51.00 0.666 0.676 0.686 0.696 0.706 0.716 0.726 $ 76.50 0.676 0.686 0.696 0.706 0.716 0.726 0.736 (a) Based on 2023 actual costs, table flexes feed cost inputs to show $0.01 impacts to per dozen egg feed production costs. INTEREST RATE RISK We have a $250 million Credit Facility, borrowings under which would bear interest at variable rates. No amounts were outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK At June 3, 2023, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 4.8 months, and the composite credit rating of the holdings are AA- / Aa3 / AA- (S&P / Moody’s / Fitch). Generally speaking, rising interest rates, as have been experienced in recent periods, decrease the value of fixed income securities portfolios. As of June 3, 2023, the estimated fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio was approximately $355 million and reflected unrealized losses of approximately $2.4 million. For additional information see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under the heading “Investment Securities” and Note 3 – Investment Securities in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas, except that at June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, 30.1% and 27.9%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club). No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable at June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 3, 2023, and the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the Index at Items 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 3, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 3, 2023, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 25, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entities’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where they can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable.

Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries record the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries either disclose the amount of a possible loss or range of loss 36 in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries disclose significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries believe there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We identified litigation and claims as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing management’s judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims. Specifically, auditing management’s determination of whether any contingent loss arising from the related litigation and claims is probable, reasonably possible, or remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the sensitivity of the issue. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during the Audit Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the controls relating to the Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings and claims, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims. These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable, and reasonably estimable, evaluating the sufficiency of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ disclosures related to legal proceedings and claims and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ legal contingencies. /s/ Frost, PLLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.

The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. Investment Securities The Company has determined that its debt securities are available-for-sale investments. We classify these securities as current because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available -for-sale securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and is recorded in interest income. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Investments in mutual funds are recorded at fair value and are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses for equity securities are recorded in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.

42 Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs, including conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free -range, pasture-raised and nutritionally-enhanced eggs. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells the majority of its shell eggs in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and of majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. The fiscal year ended June 3, 2023 , included 53 weeks and the fiscal years ended May 28, 2022 and May 29, 2021 included 52 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain bank accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.

Investments in mutual funds are recorded at fair value and are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses for equity securities are recorded in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income. 43 Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, reserves for credit losses were $ 579 thousand and $ 775 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition and credit history. Collateral is generally not required. The Company minimizes exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. In determining our reserve for credit losses, receivables are assigned an expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors. At June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 30.1 % and 27.9 % of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively. Inventories Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The cost associated with flocks, consisting principally of chicks, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during a growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over the productive lives of the flocks, generally one to two years . Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. The Company does not disclose the gross cost and accumulated amortization with respect to its flock inventories since this information is not utilized by management in the operation of the Company. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property, plant, and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant, and equipment as part of the asset to which it relates and amortizes such cost over the asset’s estimated useful life. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The equity method of accounting is used when the Company can exert significant influence over an entity, but does not control its financial and operating decisions. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these entities. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values, when the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, are recorded at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes. The Company is a member of Eggland’s Best, Inc. and ProEgg, Inc., which are cooperatives. These investments are recorded at cost, plus or minus any allocated equities and retains. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we elected to change the date of our annual impairment assessment from year- end to the first day of the fourth quarter. The change was made to more closely align the impairment assessment date with our annual planning and forecasting process. The change in impairment assessment date did not have any impact on goodwill or the impairment of goodwill. The change has been applied prospectively and would not have an impact on a retrospective basis.

The change has been applied prospectively and would not have an impact on a retrospective basis. 44 Intangible Assets Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Accrued Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide coverage for the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Dividend Payable We accrue dividends at the end of each quarter according to the Company’s dividend policy adopted by its Board of Directors. The Company pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third ( 1/3 ) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company pays dividends to shareholders of record on the 65th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the most recent quarter for which a dividend was paid. Treasury Stock Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The grant of restricted stock through the Company’s share-based compensation plans is funded through the issuance of treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares in accordance with the Company’s share- based compensation plans are credited or charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value using the average-cost method. Revenue Recognition and Delivery Costs Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 13 – Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. Advertising Costs The Company expensed advertising costs as incurred of $ 3.4 million, $ 12.6 million, and $ 11.7 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s policy with respect to evaluating uncertain tax positions is based upon whether management believes it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained upon review by the taxing authorities. The tax positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable

The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable 45 interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company initially and subsequently measures the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company records interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Based upon management’s assessment, there are no uncertain tax positions expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares, in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 14 – Stock Compensation Plans for more information. Business Combinations The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. We determine the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities internally, which requires estimates and the use of various valuation techniques. When a market value is not readily available, our internal valuation methodology considers the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets. We typically use the income method approach for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Loss Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies No new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of the acquisition, Red River became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Red River owns and operates a specialty shell egg production complex with approximately 1.7 million cage-free laying hens, cage-free pullet capacity, feed mill, processing plant, related offices and outbuildings and related equipment located on approximately 400 acres near Bogata, Texas. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Red River and the amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized at the acquisition date: Cash consideration paid $ 48,500 Fair value of the Company's equity interest in Red River held before the business combination 48,500 $ 97,000 Recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash $ 3,677 Accounts receivable, net 1,980 Inventory 8,789 Property, plant and equipment 85,002 Liabilities assumed ( 2,448 ) Deferred income taxes ( 8,481 ) Total identifiable net assets 88,519 Goodwill 8,481 $ 97,000 Cash and accounts receivable acquired along with liabilities assumed were valued at their carrying value which approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Inventory consisted primarily of flock, feed ingredients, packaging, and egg inventory. Flock inventory was valued at carrying value as management believes that their carrying value best approximates their fair value. Feed ingredients, packaging and egg inventory were all valued based on market prices as of May 30, 2021. Property, plant and equipment were valued utilizing the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the assets and subtracting any depreciation resulting from physical deterioration and/or functional or economic obsolescence. The Company recognized a gain of $ 4.5 million as a result of remeasuring to fair value its 50 % equity interest in Red River held before the business combination. The gain was recorded in other income and expense under the heading “Other, net” in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The acquisition of Red River resulted in a discrete tax benefit of $ 8.3 million, which includes a $ 7.3 million decrease in deferred income tax expense related to the outside-basis of our equity investment in Red River, with a corresponding non-recurring, non-cash $ 955,000 reduction to income taxes expense on the non- taxable remeasurement gain associated with the acquisition. As part of the acquisition accounting, the Company also recorded an $ 8.5 million deferred tax liability for the difference in the inside-basis of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of goodwill. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable, and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ● Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including: o Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets o Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets o Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability o Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data ● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities The disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022 (in thousands): June 3, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Balance Assets Municipal bonds $ — $ 16,296 $ — $ 16,296 Commercial paper — 56,409 — 56,409 Corporate bonds — 138,577 — 138,577 Certificates of deposits — 675 — 675 US government and agency obligations — 100,769 — 100,769 Asset backed securities — 13,308 — 13,308 Treasury bills — 29,056 — 29,056 Mutual funds 2,081 — — 2,081 Total assets measured at fair value $ 2,081 $ 355,090 $ — $ 357,171 May 28, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Balance Assets Municipal bonds $ — $ 10,104 $ — $ 10,104 Commercial paper — 14,868 — 14,868 Corporate bonds — 73,684 — 73,684 Certificates of deposits — 1,245 — 1,245 US government and agency obligations — 2,209 — 2,209 Asset backed securities — 13,319 — 13,319 Mutual funds 3,752 — — 3,752 Total assets measured at fair value $ 3,752 $ 115,429 $ — $ 119,181 Investment securities – available-for-sale classified as Level 2 consist of securities with maturities of three months or longer when purchased.

The Company has a KSOP plan that covers substantially all employees (the “Plan”). The Company makes contributions to the Plan at a rate of 3 % of participants eligible compensation, plus an additional amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Contributions can be made in cash or the Company’s Common Stock, and vest immediately. The Company’s cash contributions to the Plan were $ 4.3 million, $ 3.9 million, and $ 3.8 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company did no t make direct contributions of the Company’s Common Stock in fiscal years 2023, 2022, or 2021. Dividends on the Company’s Common Stock are paid to the Plan in cash. The Plan acquires the Company’s Common Stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ, by using the dividends and the Company’s cash contribution to purchase shares in the public markets. The Plan sells Common Stock on the NASDAQ to pay benefits to Plan participants. Participants may make contributions to the Plan up to the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Company does not match participant contributions. Deferred Compensation Plans The Company has deferred compensation agreements with certain officers for payments to be made over specified periods beginning when the officers reach age 65 or over as specified in the agreements. Amounts accrued for the agreements are based upon deferred compensation earned over the estimated remaining service period of each officer. Payments made under these agreements were $ 170 thousand in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The liability recorded related to these agreements was 52 $ 1.0 million and $ 1.1 million at June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, respectively and are classified within “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company sponsors an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which was amended and restated effective December 1, 2021 (the “Amended DC Plan”) to expand eligibility for participation from named officers only to a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company, expand the investment options available and add the ability of participants to make elective deferrals. Participants may be awarded long-term incentive contributions (“Awards”) under the Amended DC Plan. Awards vest on December 31 st of the fifth year after such contribution is credited to the Amended DC Plan or, if earlier, the participant’s attainment of age 60 with 5 years of service. Awards issued under the Amended DC Plan were $ 388 thousand, $ 340 thousand, and $ 279 thousand in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Payments made under the Amended DC Plan were $ 410 thousand, $ 480 thousand and $ 55 thousand in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The liability recorded for the Amended DC Plan was $ 4.6 million, $ 4.5 million and $ 4.1 million at June 3, 2023, May 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively and is classified within “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Deferred compensation expense for both plans totaled $ 346 thousand, $ 258 thousand and $ 1.6 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Other Postretirement Employee Benefits The Company maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan to provide limited health benefits to certain qualified retired employees and officers. Retired non-officers and spouses are eligible for coverage until attainment of Medicare eligibility, at which time coverage ceases. Retired officers and spouses are eligible for lifetime benefits under the plan. Officers, who retired prior to May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A and B. Officers, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 and their spouses must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. The plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”), whereby an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, this expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employees’ approximate period of employment. The liability associated with the plan was $ 2.7 million and $ 3.4 million at June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, respectively. The remaining disclosures associated with ASC 715 are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements. Effective March 1, 2023, the Company adopted a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) and a split dollar life insurance plan (“Split Dollar Plan”) designed to provide deferred compensation and a pre-retirement death benefit for a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Company. Provided the vesting conditions are met, participants in the SERP are eligible to receive an aggregate retirement benefit of $ 500,000 , which is paid in annual installments of $ 50,000 for 10 years . A participant becomes vested in the retirement benefit over five years of plan participation at 20 % per year. If a participant becomes disabled, attains the retirement age of 65, or the Company experiences a change in control, vesting will be accelerated to 100 %. If a participant dies while employed, he or she will not receive any benefits under the SERP, but their beneficiaries will instead be entitled to the life insurance benefit provided under the Split Dollar Plan, which is $500,000. The liability recorded for these plans was $ 63 thousand at June 3, 2023 and is classified within “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 10 - Credit Facility For fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, interest expense was $ 583 thousand, $ 403 thousand, and $ 213 thousand, respectively, primarily related to commitment fees on the Credit Facility described below. On May 26, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated November 15, 2021 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Amendment replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate interest rate benchmark with the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). The Credit Agreement has a five -year term. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or “Revolver”) in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $ 250 million, which includes a $ 15 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 15 million sublimit for swingline loans. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature permitting, with the consent of BMO Harris Bank N.A. (the “Administrative Agent”), an increase in the Credit Facility in the aggregate up to $ 200 million by adding one or more incremental senior secured term loans or increasing one or more times the revolving commitments under the Revolver.

No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of June 3, 2023 or May 28, 2022 or during fiscal 2023 or 53 fiscal 2022. The Company had $ 4.3 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility at June 3, 2023. The interest rate in connection with loans made under the Credit Facility is based on, at the Company’s election, either the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Adjusted Term SOFR” means with respect to any tenor, the per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) Term SOFR as defined in the Credit Agreement plus (ii) 0.10 % (10 basis points); provided, if Adjusted Term SOFR determined as provided above shall ever be less than the Floor, then Adjusted Term SOFR shall be deemed to be the Floor. The “Floor” means the rate per annum of interest equal to 0.00 %. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one -month tenor plus 1.00 %. The “Applicable Margin” means 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for SOFR Loans, in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility payable quarterly from 0.15 % to 0.25 % in each case depending upon the Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio for the Company at the quarterly pricing date. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly -owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”), and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement for the Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a maximum Total Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio tested quarterly of no greater than 50 %; and (ii) a requirement to maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth at all times of $ 700 Million plus 50 % of net income (if net income is positive) less permitted restricted payments for each fiscal quarter after November 27, 2021. Additionally, the Credit Agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr.’s spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100 % of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50 % of the Company's voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the Credit Agreement. Further, under the terms of the Credit Agreement, payment of dividends under the Company's current dividend policy of one-third of the Company's net income computed in accordance with GAAP and payment of other dividends or repurchases by the Company of its capital stock is allowed, as long as after giving effect to such dividend payments or repurchases no default has occurred and is continuing and the sum of cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries plus availability under the Credit Facility equals at least $ 50 million. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due under the Credit Facility and foreclosure of the collateral securing the Credit Facility. At June 3, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility. Note 11 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”), holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes.

Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 77.5 million, $ 62.7 million, and $ 52.7 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 77.5 million, $ 62.7 million, and $ 52.7 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 55 Returns and Refunds Some of our contracts include a guaranteed sale clause, pursuant to which we credit the customer’s account for product that the customer is unable to sell before expiration. The Company records an allowance for expected customer returns using historical return data and comparing to current period sales and accounts receivable . The allowance is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. Sales Incentives Provided to Customers The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ Disaggregation of Revenue The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 14 Weeks Ended 13 Weeks Ended 53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended June 3, 2023 May 28, 2022 June 3, 2023 May 28, 2022 Conventional shell egg sales $ 395,433 $ 378,190 $ 2,051,961 $ 1,061,995 Specialty shell egg sales 256,190 186,518 956,993 648,838 Egg products 33,996 26,488 122,270 60,004 Other 3,061 1,768 14,993 6,322 $ 688,680 $ 592,964 $ 3,146,217 $ 1,777,159 Contract Costs The Company can incur costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. If the amortization period of these costs is less than one year, they are expensed as incurred. When the amortization period is greater than one year, a contract asset is recognized and is amortized over the contract life as a reduction in net sales. As of June 3, 2023 and May 28, 2022, the balance for contract assets is immaterial. Contract Balances The Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from delivery. There are rarely contract assets or liabilities related to performance under the contract. Concentration of Credit Risks Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. (including Sam's Club) accounted for 34.2 %, 29.5 % and 29.8 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. H-E-B, LP accounted for 10.1 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 2021. Note 14 - Stock Compensation Plans On October 2, 2020, shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 2012 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP Plan”). The purpose of the LTIP Plan is to assist us and our subsidiaries in attracting and retaining selected individuals who are expected to contribute to our long-term success. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for awards under the LTIP Plan is 2,000,000 of which 941,593 shares remain available for issuance, and may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares. Awards may be granted under the LTIP Plan to any employee, any non- employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and any consultant who is a natural person and provides services to us or one of our subsidiaries (except for incentive stock options, which may be granted only to our employees). The only outstanding awards under the LTIP Plan are restricted stock awards. The restricted stock vests three years from the grant date, or upon death or disability, change in control, or retirement (subject to certain requirements). The restricted stock contains no other service or performance conditions. Restricted stock is awarded in the name of the recipient and, except for the right of

Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC On April 23, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary Wharton County Foods, LLC (“WCF”) were named as defendants in State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The State of Texas (the “State”) asserted claims based on the Company’s and WCF’s alleged violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices—Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 17.41-17.63 (“DTPA”). The State claimed that the Company and WCF offered shell eggs at excessive or exorbitant prices during the COVID-19 state of emergency and made misleading statements about shell egg prices. The State sought temporary and permanent injunctions against the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $ 100,000 in damages. On August 13, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the State’s original petition with prejudice. On September 11, 2020, the State filed a notice of appeal, which was assigned to the Texas Court of Appeals for the First District. On August 16, 2022, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings. On October 31, 2022, the Company and WCF appealed the First District Court’s decision to the Supreme Court of Texas. On May 10, 2023, the Company filed its brief on the merits, and the State of Texas filed its brief on June 29, 2023. The Company filed its reply brief on July 14, 2023. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al. On April 30, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:20- cv-461, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. The defendants include numerous grocery stores, retailers, producers, and farms. Plaintiffs assert that defendants violated the DTPA by allegedly demanding exorbitant or excessive prices for eggs during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs request certification of a class of all consumers who purchased eggs in Texas sold, distributed, produced, or handled by any of the defendants during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from selling eggs at a price more than 10% greater than the price of eggs prior to the declaration of the state of emergency and damages in the amount of $ 10,000 per violation, or $ 250,000 for each violation impacting anyone over 65 years old. On December 1, 2020, the Company and certain other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended class action complaint. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to strike, and the motion to dismiss and related proceedings were referred to a United States magistrate judge. On July 14, 2021, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to the court that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be granted and the case be dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On September 20, 2021, the court dismissed the case without prejudice. On July 13, 2022, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to set aside or amend the judgment to amend their complaint. On March 15, 2022, plaintiffs filed a second suit against the Company and several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-246, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division alleging the same assertions as laid out in the first complaint. On August 12, 2022, the Company and other defendants in the case filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ class action complaint. On January 9, 2023, the court entered an order and final judgement granting the Company’s motion to dismiss. On February 8, 2023, the plaintiffs appealed the lower court’s judgement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Case No. 23-50112. The parties filed their respective appellate briefs, but the court has not ruled on these submissions. Management believes the risk of material loss related to both matters to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and, until a subsequent settlement was reached as described below, The Kellogg Company.

Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and, until a subsequent settlement was reached as described below, The Kellogg Company. 59 On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. On May 2, 2022, the court set trial for October 24, 2022, but on September 20, 2022, the court cancelled the trial date due to COVID-19 protocols and converted the trial date to a status hearing to reschedule the jury trial. Trial is now set for October 16, 2023. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, and on March 28, 2022, the court dismissed the Company with prejudice. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: two earlier trials based on substantially the same facts and legal arguments resulted in findings of no conspiracy and/or damages; this trial will be before a different judge and jury in a different court than prior related cases; there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and there are requests for damages other than compensatory damages (i.e., injunction and treble money damages). State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc., Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc., George’s, Inc., Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc., and certain of their affiliates. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint sought injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages was dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed in or around 2005. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100 % of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. We also have a number of small contract producers that operate in the area. The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the State of Oklahoma, but no penalties were assessed. The court found the defendants liable for state law nuisance, federal common law nuisance, and state law trespass. The court also found the producers vicariously liable for the actions of their contract producers. The court directed the parties to confer in attempt to reach agreement on appropriate remedies. On June 12, 2023, the court ordered the parties to mediate before the Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha and instructed the parties to file a joint status report fourteen days following mediation. The mediation has not yet been set but is expected to be in the September to October time frame this fall. While management believes there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss from the case, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: uncertainties inherent in any assessment of potential costs associated with injunctive relief or other penalties based on a decision in a case tried over 13 years ago based on environmental conditions that existed at the time, the lack of guidance from the court as to what might be considered appropriate remedies, the ongoing negotiations with the State on appropriate remedies and upcoming mediation, and uncertainty regarding what our proportionate share of any remedy would be, although we believe that our share compared to the other defendants is small. Other Matters In addition to the above, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.

59 On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. On May 2, 2022, the court set trial for October 24, 2022, but on September 20, 2022, the court cancelled the trial date due to COVID-19 protocols and converted the trial date to a status hearing to reschedule the jury trial. Trial is now set for October 16, 2023. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, and on March 28, 2022, the court dismissed the Company with prejudice. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: two earlier trials based on substantially the same facts and legal arguments resulted in findings of no conspiracy and/or damages; this trial will be before a different judge and jury in a different court than prior related cases; there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and there are requests for damages other than compensatory damages (i.e., injunction and treble money damages). State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc., Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc., George’s, Inc., Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc., and certain of their affiliates. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint sought injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages was dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed in or around 2005. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100 % of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. We also have a number of small contract producers that operate in the area. The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the State of Oklahoma, but no penalties were assessed. The court found the defendants liable for state law nuisance, federal common law nuisance, and state law trespass. The court also found the producers vicariously liable for the actions of their contract producers. The court directed the parties to confer in attempt to reach agreement on appropriate remedies. On June 12, 2023, the court ordered the parties to mediate before the Tenth Circuit Chief Judge Deanell Reece Tacha and instructed the parties to file a joint status report fourteen days following mediation. The mediation has not yet been set but is expected to be in the September to October time frame this fall.

(b) Attestation Report of the Registrant’s Public Accounting Firm 62 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of June 3, 2023, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as June 3, 2023, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries and our report dated July 25, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entities’ internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCOAB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting An entities’ internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entities’ internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entities; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entities are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entities; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entities’ assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Frost, PLLC Little Rock, Arkansas July 25, 2023
