Table of Contents ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISK FACTORS; FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, securities, financial condition or operating results, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Item 1A . Risk Factors . In addition, because the following discussion includes numerous forward-looking statements relating to us, our results of operations, financial condition and business, reference is made to the information set forth in the section of Part I immediately preceding Item 1 above under the caption “ Forward-Looking Statements .” BACKGROUND Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs. Our fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to May 31.  The Company, which is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells the majority of its shell eggs in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our operations are fully integrated. We hatch chicks, grow and maintain flocks of pullets (female chickens, under 18 weeks of age), layers (mature female chickens) and breeders (male and female birds used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks), manufacture feed, and produce, process, market and distribute shell eggs. In fiscal 2020, we sold approximately 1,069 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 19% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 40 million layers and 11 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. We sell most of our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, food service distributors, and egg product consumers. The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products. We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as conventional products. While we report separate sales information for these types of eggs, there are a number of cost factors which are not specifically available for conventional or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. Our operating results are materially impacted by market prices for eggs and feed grains (corn and soybean meal), which are highly volatile, independent of each other, and out of our control. Generally speaking, higher market prices for eggs have a positive impact on our financial results while higher market prices for feed grains have a negative impact on our financial results. Although we use a variety of pricing mechanisms in pricing agreements with our customers, we sell the majority of our conventional shell eggs based on formulas that take into account, in varying ways, independently quoted regional wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. As an example of the volatility in the market prices of shell eggs, the Urner-Barry Southeastern Regional Large Egg Market Price per dozen eggs ("UB southeastern large index") in fiscal year 2020 ranged from a low of $0.62 in July 2019 to a high of $3.18 in March 2020. Generally, we purchase primary feed ingredients, mainly corn and soybean meal, at current market prices. Corn and soybean meal are commodities and are subject to volatile price changes due to weather, various supply and demand factors, transportation and storage costs, speculators, and agricultural, energy and trade policies in the U.S. and internationally. 23

Table of Contents Specialty shell eggs have been a significant and growing portion of the market. In recent years, a significant number of large restaurant chains, food service companies and grocery chains, including our largest customers, announced goals to transition to an exclusively cage-free egg supply chain by specified future dates. Additionally, several states have passed legislation requiring cage-free eggs by specified future dates, and other states are considering such legislation. For additional information, see Item 1. Business, Government Regulation. Our growth strategy is focused on remaining a low-cost provider of shell eggs located near our customers. In light of the growing customer demand and increased legal requirements for cage-free eggs, we intend to continue to closely evaluate the need to expand through selective acquisitions, with a priority on those that will facilitate our ability to expand our cage-free shell egg production capabilities in key locations and markets. We plan to continue to closely evaluate the need to continue to expand and convert our own facilities to increase production of cage-free eggs based on current demand. As the ongoing production of cage-free eggs is more costly than the production of conventional eggs, aligning our cage-free production capabilities with changing demand for cage-free eggs is important to the success of our business. Since January 2020, the coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak, characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets. For a discussion of our response to COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1, Business – Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. We discuss the pandemic and potential future implications of the pandemic in this report; however, the pandemic is an evolving and challenging situation, and its impact on our business in the future is uncertain. The shell egg industry has traditionally been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant loss. In the past, during periods of high profitability, shell egg producers tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs, which generally caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand returned to balance. As a result, our financial results from year to year may vary significantly. Shorter term, retail sales of shell eggs historically have been highest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months. Prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal demand factors and a natural increase in laying hen productivity and shell egg production during the spring and early summer. Historically, shell egg prices have tended to increase with the start of the school year and tended to be highest prior to holiday periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. Consequently, and all other things being equal, we would expect to experience lower sales and net income (and may incur net losses) in our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in August/September and May/June, respectively. Because of the seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, comparisons of our sales and operating results between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons. Executive Overview of Results – Fiscal Years Ended May 30, 2020, June 1, 2019 and June 2, 2018 Fiscal Years Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 June 2, 2018 Net sales (in thousands) $ 1,351,609 $ 1,361,188 $ 1,502,932 Gross profit (in thousands) $ 179,588 $ 222,859 $ 361,046 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 1.231 $ 1.265 $ 1.397 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 1.220 $ 1.229 $ 1.490 Feed cost per dozen produced $ 0.409 $ 0.415 $ 0.394 a. The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. Compared to fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in an oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half of the fiscal year, which led to lower selling prices for conventional eggs. This resulted in decreased gross profit and net income for fiscal 2019. 24

--- PAGE 25 ---
Table of Contents Throughout the first three quarters of our fiscal year 2020, an oversupply of eggs negatively affected the price of conventional eggs, and demand for specialty eggs was negatively impacted by the low conventional egg prices. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was down 21.9% compared with the prior-year period, but in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was 62.4% higher than the average price through the first three quarters in fiscal 2020 due to increased demand related to the pandemic, as consumers purchased more eggs in anticipation of preparing more meals at home. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years indicated, certain items from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales. May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 86.7 % 83.6 % Gross profit 13.3 % 16.4 % Selling, general and administrative 13.0 % 12.8 % Legal settlement expense 0.1 % 0.2 % Operating income (loss) 0.2 % 3.4 % Total other income, net 1.4 % 1.8 % Income (loss) before income taxes 1.6 % 5.2 % Income tax (benefit) expense 0.1 % 1.2 % Net income (loss) 1.5 % 4.0 % Less: Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest — % 0.1 % Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. 1.5 % 3.9 % Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 NET SALES Net sales for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 were $1,351.6 million, a decrease of $9.6 million, or 0.7%, from net sales of $1,361.2 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes for specialty eggs, lower prices of conventional eggs during the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 and a decline in revenue from egg product sales. In fiscal 2020 and 2019, shell egg sales made up approximately 97.7% and 97.0% of our net sales, respectively. Total dozens sold in fiscal 2020 were 1,069.2 million, an increase of 30.3 million dozen, or 2.9%, compared to 1,038.9 million sold in fiscal 2019 resulting in an increase in net sales of $37.2 million for fiscal 2020 compared with the prior fiscal year. The net average selling price of shell eggs decreased from $1.265 per dozen for fiscal 2019 to $1.231 per dozen for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $0.034 per dozen, or 2.7%. Shell egg prices were lower throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily reflecting an oversupply of eggs in the market. Demand for specialty eggs and specialty egg prices were negatively impacted by the low conventional egg prices. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, the average UB southeastern large index price was down 22% compared with the prior-year period, but in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was 62% higher than in the average price of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 due to increased demand related to the pandemic, as consumers purchased more eggs in anticipation of preparing more meals at home. The UB southeastern large index price ranged from a high of $3.18 to a low of $1.02 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The decrease in sales price in fiscal 2020 from fiscal 2019 resulted in a corresponding decrease in net sales of approximately $35.3 million. 25

Table of Contents Hen numbers reported by the USDA as of June 1, 2020, were 319.8 million, which is 13.9 million fewer hens than reported a year ago, when the USDA also reported high flock productivity, which led to an oversupply of eggs and a significant decline in prices. The USDA reported that the hatch from January through May 2020 decreased 5.0%, including a 13.1% decrease in May, as compared to the same period in the prior year, which will affect future egg supply levels. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we lost a portion of our of conventional eggs sales to a major customer in the Southeast region, representing 4.6% of total shell egg dozens and 6.1% of conventional egg dozens for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, the volume decreased by 2.8% of total shell egg dozens and 3.7% of conventional shell egg dozens due to this loss of  business. However, we expect our new capacity additions and the decommissioning of some older, less efficient facilities that occurred during fiscal 2020 will help optimize our operations, improve our sales mix, and better align our production and sales within the region. The recent acquisition of Mahard Egg Farm ("Mahard") had a positive impact on our conventional shell egg volumes and continued growth of our customer base. For fiscal year 2020, the volume of total shell egg dozens increased by 3.5% and the volume of conventional shell egg dozens increased by 4.4% due to the acquisition. Furthermore, the acquisition opened up opportunities to streamline aspects of our operations, reduce costs and create efficiencies as we integrated Mahard into our operations. The table below presents an analysis of our conventional and specialty shell egg sales (in thousands, except percentage data): Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Total net sales $ 1,351,609 $ 1,361,188 Conventional $ 830,278 62.9 % $ 810,306 61.4 % Specialty 485,465 36.8 % 504,169 38.2 % Egg sales, net 1,315,743 99.7 % 1,314,475 99.6 % Other 4,452 0.3 % 5,205 0.4 % Net shell egg sales $ 1,320,195 100.0 % $ 1,319,680 100.0 % Net shell egg sales as a percent of total net sales 97.7 % 97.0 % Dozens sold: Conventional 813,255 76.1 % 778,052 74.9 % Specialty 255,895 23.9 % 260,848 25.1 % Total dozens sold 1,069,150 100.0 % 1,038,900 100.0 % Net average selling price per dozen: Conventional $ 1.021 $ 1.041 Specialty $ 1.897 $ 1.933 All shell eggs $ 1.231 $ 1.265 Conventional shell eggs include all shell egg sales not specifically identified as specialty shell egg sales. In fiscal 2020, conventional shell eggs represented approximately 62.9% of our shell egg revenue, compared to 61.4% for fiscal 2019. Sales of conventional shell eggs accounted for approximately 76.1% and 74.9% of total shell egg volume in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue from conventional egg sales increased by $20.0 million from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 due to an increase in volume, as net average selling prices decreased. Our net average selling price for conventional eggs was $1.021 per dozen for fiscal 2020 compared to $1.041 per dozen for fiscal 2019. 26

--- PAGE 27 ---
Table of Contents Specialty eggs, which include nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, organic and brown eggs, continued to make up a significant portion of our total shell egg revenue and dozens sold. For fiscal 2020, specialty eggs accounted for 36.8% of shell egg revenue, compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2019. Specialty eggs accounted for 23.9% of shell egg volume in fiscal 2020 compared with 25.1% fiscal 2019. Revenue from specialty egg sales decreased by $18.7 million from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 due to decreases in both volume and prices. Our net average selling price for specialty eggs was $1.897  per dozen for fiscal 2020 compared to $1.933 per dozen for fiscal 2019. Specialty egg retail prices are less cyclical than conventional shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay more for specialty eggs. Specialty egg prices decreased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher priced organic egg sales volumes decreasing as a proportion of total specialty sales. The shell egg sales classified as “Other sales” represent hard cooked eggs, hatching eggs, other egg products, hens, and manure, which are included with our shell egg operations. We sell liquid and frozen egg products primarily to the institutional, food service, and food manufacturing sectors in the U.S through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American Egg Products, LLC ("AEP") and Texas Egg Products, LLC ("TEP"). Egg products accounted for approximately 2.3% and 3.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2020, egg product sales were $31.4 million, a decrease of $10.1 million, or 24.3%, compared to $41.5 million for fiscal 2019. Egg products volume for fiscal 2020 was 66.0 million pounds, an increase of 5.1 million pounds, or 8.4%, compared to 60.8 million pounds for fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, the selling price per pound was $0.476 compared to $0.685 for fiscal 2019, a decrease of 30.5%. The decline in revenue is attributable to the lower selling prices brought on by an oversupply of eggs throughout the first three quarters in fiscal 2020, followed by a decline in food service demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs from outside producers, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization, and other related farm production costs. 27

Table of Contents The following table presents the key variables affecting our cost of sales (in thousands, except cost per dozen data): Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 % Change Cost of Sales: Farm production $ 677,181 $ 635,797 6.5 % Processing, packaging, and warehouse 234,243 222,765 5.2 % Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) 232,027 249,605 (7.0) % Total shell eggs 1,143,451 1,108,167 3.2 % Egg products 25,651 29,020 (11.6) % Other 2,919 1,142 155.6 % Total $ 1,172,021 $ 1,138,329 3.0 % Farm production cost (per dozen produced) Feed $ 0.409 $ 0.415 (1.4) % Other $ 0.329 $ 0.319 3.1 % Total $ 0.738 $ 0.734 0.5 % Outside egg purchases (average cost per dozen) $ 1.26 $ 1.26 — % Dozen produced 927,799 876,705 5.8 % Dozen sold 1,069,150 1,038,900 2.9 % Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 was $1,172.0 million, an increase of $33.7 million, or 3.0%, compared to $1,138.3 million for fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to the increase in dozens produced driven primarily by the Mahard acquisition. For the 2020 fiscal year, we produced 86.8% of the eggs sold by us, compared to 84.4% for the previous year. Feed cost for fiscal 2020 was $0.409 per dozen, compared to $0.415 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, a decrease of 1.4%. The decrease in feed cost per dozen resulted in a decrease in cost of sales of $5.6 million for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. Included in cost of sales for fiscal 2020 is a non-cash impairment loss on fixed assets of $2.9 million (included in the line item “Other” in the table above) related to decommissioning some of our older, less efficient production facilities as we continue to invest in new facilities to meet the increasing demand for specialty eggs and reduce production costs. We continue to proactively monitor and manage operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional related costs that we have incurred or many incur in the future. In fiscal 2020, we spent an additional $2.8 million related to the pandemic. The majority of the expenses were related to supplemental pay including employee benefits and additional labor. Looking forward to fiscal 2021, according to USDA reports, current supplies of corn and soybeans are favorable, and we believe we will continue to have an adequate supply of both grains in fiscal 2021. However, current ongoing uncertainties and supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, weather and geopolitical issues surrounding trade agreements and international tariffs may lead to further price volatility. 28

--- PAGE 29 ---
Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 13.3% for fiscal 2020, compared to 16.4% for fiscal 2019. The decrease resulted primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs through the first three quarters in fiscal 2020. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SGA") include costs of marketing, distribution, accounting, and corporate overhead.  The following table presents an analysis of our SGA expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Years Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 $ Change % Change Specialty egg expense $ 49,237 $ 53,263 $ (4,026) (7.6) % Delivery expense 52,230 53,595 (1,365) (2.5) % Payroll, taxes and benefits 44,156 42,454 1,702 4.0 % Stock compensation expense 3,617 3,619 (2) (0.1) % Other expenses 28,997 24,114 4,883 20.2 % Total $ 178,237 $ 177,045 $ 1,192 0.7 % For fiscal year 2020, SGA was $178.2 million compared to $177.0 million for fiscal 2019. Specialty egg expense decreased $4.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to the same period of the prior year. Specialty egg expense typically fluctuates directly with specialty egg dozens sold, which decreased 1.9% for fiscal 2020. Franchise fees and advertising expense combined decreased $4.1 million for fiscal 2020. Both are components of specialty egg expense and are driven by specialty dozens sold. Payroll, taxes and benefits increased $1.7 million or 4.0%, primarily due to increased employer provided insurance benefits (health, disability and life). Other expenses increased $4.9 million or 20.2% compared to fiscal 2019. This increase is primarily due to increased property and casualty insurance premiums and an increase in charitable donations. OPERATING INCOME As a result of the above, our operating income was $1.3 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $45.8 million for fiscal 2019. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Total other income (expense) consists of items not directly charged to, or related to, operations such as interest income and expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, among other items. The Company recorded interest income of $5.0 million in fiscal 2020, compared to $8.0 million for fiscal 2019. We recorded interest expense of $498,000 and $644,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in interest income resulted from significantly lower investment balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Patronage dividends, which represent distributions from our membership in Eggland's Best, Inc. ("EB"), decreased $386,000 from $10.5 million in fiscal 2019 to $10.1 million in fiscal 2020. Patronage dividends are paid once a year based on profits of EB as well as their available cash. 29

--- PAGE 30 ---
Table of Contents Equity in income from unconsolidated entities for fiscal 2020 was $534,000 compared to $4.8 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease of $4.2 million is primarily due to the decrease in egg selling prices through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 impacting the profitability of our joint ventures. Other, net for fiscal 2020 was income of $3.7 million compared to $2.4 million for fiscal 2019. The increase is primarily driven by realized and unrealized gains in investment securities available-for-sale. INCOME TAXES On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“the CARES Act”) was enacted. The most significant provision of the CARES Act that materially affected the Company’s income taxes included the five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in the tax years 2018 through 2020, our fiscal years 2019 through 2021. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 disallowed the carrying back of taxable net operating losses to offset prior years’ taxable income. The CARES Act allows us to carry those losses generated or that maybe generated during our fiscal years 2019 through 2021 back to offset taxable income recognized during the prior five years. The Company is electing to utilize that provision, which will provide additional liquidity in the form of an income tax refund currently estimated to be approximately $6.9 million. We believe we will receive the refund during our second fiscal quarter of 2021. Additionally, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $2.4 million related to the carryback provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For more information regarding the income tax effects of the CARES Act, refer to "Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 7 - Income Taxes ." For the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020, our pre-tax income was $20.1 million, compared to $70.8 million for fiscal 2019. Income tax expense of $1.7 million was recorded for fiscal 2020 compared to $15.7 million for fiscal 2019. Our fiscal 2020 effective tax rate decreased to 8.6% from 22.5% in fiscal 2019, driven primarily by the net operating loss carryback provisions allowed under the CARES Act, which became law during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding the effects of the CARES Act, the Company’s fiscal 2020 effective tax rate would have been approximately 24.1%. At May 30, 2020, the Company had an income tax receivable of $9.9 million compared to $9.7 million at June 1, 2019. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company received an $8.4 million federal tax refund related to the filing of its fiscal 2019 tax return. The Company recorded an income tax receivable of $6.9 million related to the decision to carryback fiscal 2020 taxable net operating losses to recover a portion of taxes paid in fiscal 2015. An additional $1.6 million income tax receivable was recorded for claims for refund filed with state taxing authorities. For the thirteen weeks ended May 30, 2020, our pretax income was $77.6 million and our income tax expense was $17.1 million with an effective tax rate of 22.03%, including the impact of the CARES Act. Our income tax provision for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects the carryback of taxable net operating losses generated during periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 21% to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 35%, as permitted by the CARES Act. The low effective rate was primarily related to the $2.4 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the CARES Act. Items causing our effective tax rate to differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% are state income taxes, certain federal tax credits and certain items included in income or loss for financial reporting purposes that are not included in taxable income or loss for income tax purposes, including tax exempt interest income, certain nondeductible expenses, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. 30

Table of Contents NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2020 was a loss of $63 thousand compared to income of $833 thousand for fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, we acquired the remaining 27.9% interest in our majority-owned subsidiary TEP. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income for fiscal 2020 was $18.4 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, compared to $54.2 million, or $1.12 per basic and diluted share for fiscal 2019. Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 2, 2018 The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 2, 2018 can be found in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our working capital at May 30, 2020 was $429.1 million, compared to $492.8 million at June 1, 2019. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 5.6 at May 30, 2020 compared to 7.6 at June 1, 2019. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Due to seasonal factors described under the heading "Background" above, we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the last and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we retired all outstanding long-term debt. As such there was no long-term debt at May 30, 2020, compared to $1.5 million at June 1, 2019.  On July 10, 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (“the Revolving Credit Facility”). As of May 30, 2020, no amounts were borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility.  We have $4.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were issued under our Revolving Credit Facility for the benefit of certain insurance companies. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Financial Statements Note 10 - Credit Facilities and Long-Term De b t for further information regarding our long-term debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $73.6 million for fiscal year 2020 compared with $115.1 million for fiscal year 2019. Decreased gross profit margins resulting primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs through the first three quarters contributed greatly to our decrease in cash flow from operations. The increase in accounts receivables balance at fiscal 2020 compared to prior fiscal 2019 is due to higher prices and quantities sold of shell eggs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Increase in accounts payable balance at fiscal 2020 compared to prior fiscal 2019 is due to higher prices quantities purchased of shell eggs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, approximately $204.3 million was provided from the sale and maturity of short-term investments, $107.2 million was used to purchase short-term investments and net payments of $7.1 million were received from investments in unconsolidated entities. We used $44.7 million to acquire Mahard and the remaining interest in TEP. Approximately $124.2 million was used to purchase or construct property, plant and equipment, most of which related to the expansion of our cage-free shell egg production capacity. Refer to the table of material construction projects presented below for additional information on purchases and construction of property, plant and equipment. We used $1.5 million for principal payments on long-term debt. The net result of these and other activities as of May 30, 2020 was an increase in cash of $8.9 million from June 1, 2019. For fiscal 2019, approximately $209.8 million was provided from the sale and maturity of short-term investments, $177.0 million was used to purchase short-term investments and net payments of $7.9 million were received from 31

Table of Contents investments in unconsolidated entities. We used $17.9 million to acquire Featherland Egg Farms. We invested $4.3 million in unconsolidated entities. Approximately $68.0 million was used to purchase property, plant and equipment. Approximately $3.8 million was used for principal payments on long-term debt and $41.7 million for the payment of dividends. The net result of these and other activities as of June 1, 2019 was an increase in cash of $20.8 million from June 2, 2018. We continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free, organic and other specialty eggs in order to meet our customers' demand. We have invested over $371.7 million in facilities, equipment and related operations to expand our cage-free production starting with our first facility in 2008. The following table presents current material construction projects approved as of May 30, 2020 (in thousands): Project(s) Type Projected Completion Projected Cost Spent as of May 30, 2020 Remaining Projected Cost Convertible/Cage-Free Layer Houses & Pullet Houses Fiscal 2021 38,032 28,412 9,620 Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses/Processing Facility Fiscal 2022 87,204 50,411 36,793 $ 125,236 $ 78,823 $ 46,413 We believe our current cash balances, investments, cash flows from operations, and Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our current and projected capital needs for at least the next twelve months.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management suggests our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, as described in Note 1 in Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe the critical accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements are described below. 32

--- PAGE 33 ---
Table of Contents INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments-Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers all debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value and no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months as available-for-sale, and carries them at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are included in other income. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined on the specific identification method. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our customers on a short-term basis. Although credit risk associated with our customers is considered minimal, we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts. In circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g. bankruptcy filings), a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on the length of time the receivables are past due, generally 100% for amounts more than 60 days past due. INVENTORIES Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. If market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower, we record adjustments to write-down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value. The cost associated with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s productive life, generally one to two years. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Depreciable long-lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings, improvements, machinery and equipment. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. An increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense. When property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. We continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, for events or changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use. 33

--- PAGE 34 ---
Table of Contents EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS We have invested in other companies engaged in the production, processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products. These investments are recorded using the cost or equity method, and are not consolidated in our financial statements. Changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used. Our investment in these companies is shown on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amounts presented for "Investment in unconsolidated entities" and “Other long-term assets”. GOODWILL Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. At May 30, 2020, goodwill represented 2.9% of total assets and 3.5% of stockholders’ equity. Goodwill relates to the following (in thousands): Fiscal Year Description Amount 1999 Acquisition of Hudson Brothers, Inc. $ 3,147 2006 Acquisition of Hillandale Farms, LLC 869 2007 Acquisition of Green Forest Foods, LLC 179 2008 Revised Hillandale incremental purchase price 9,257 2009 Revised Hillandale incremental purchase price 2,527 2009 Acquisition of Zephyr Egg, LLC 1,876 2009 Acquisition of Tampa Farms, LLC 4,600 2010 Revised Hillandale incremental purchase price (338) 2013 Acquisition of Maxim Production Co., Inc. 2,300 2014 Purchase of joint venture partner’s 50% in Delta Egg 4,779 2017 Acquisition of Foodonics International, Inc. 3,389 2017 Acquisition of Happy Hen Egg Farms, Inc. 2,940 Total Goodwill $ 35,525 REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DELIVERY COSTS Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 1 4 : Revenue Recognition in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. SALES INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted 34

--- PAGE 35 ---
Table of Contents by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 1 6 - Stock Compensation Plans in Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. INCOME TAXES We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. Any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate. ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of conventional eggs, which are subject to significant price fluctuations that are largely beyond our control.  Our exposure to market risk also includes changes in the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as conventional shell egg prices. The following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed cost per dozen: Feed ingredient Approximate change in feed ingredient cost Approximate impact on feed costs per dozen Approximate dollar impact on farm production cost for the 2020 fiscal year Corn $0.28 change in the average market price per bushel $ 0.01 $ 9,278,000 Soybean Meal $27.50 change in the average market price per ton $ 0.01 $ 9,278,000 We generally do not enter into long-term contracts to purchase corn and soybean meal or hedge against increases in the price of corn and soybean meal. INTEREST RATE RISK The fair value of our debt is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. At May 30, 2020, there was no long-term debt outstanding. In July 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility which bears interest at a variable rate. No amounts were outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2020. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK At May 30, 2020, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 8.3 months, and the composite credit rating of the holdings are A- / A3 / A- (S&P / Moody’s / Fitch). 35

--- PAGE 36 ---
Table of Contents CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas, except that at May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, 29.5% and 29.6%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club). No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable. 36

Table of Contents ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Jackson, Mississippi Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 30, 2020, and the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 30, 2020, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 17, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.  We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 37

--- PAGE 38 ---
Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company records liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable.  Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate.  The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made.  The Company discloses significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. We identified litigation and claims as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing management’s judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims.  Specifically, auditing management’s determination of whether any contingent loss arising from the related litigation and claims is probable, reasonably possible or remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the sensitivity of the issue. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during the Audit Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the controls relating to the Company’s evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings and claims, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims.  These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of the Company’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to legal proceedings and claims and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s legal contingencies. /s/Frost, PLLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.

Table of Contents Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements May 30, 2020 Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packing and sale of fresh shell eggs, including cage-free, organic and nutritionally-enhanced eggs. The Company, which is headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells the majority of its shell eggs in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. Each of the year-to-date periods ended May 30, 2020, June 1, 2019, and June 2, 2018 included 52 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and may change materially in future periods. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain bank accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $250,000. The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement account for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. At May 30, 2020, and June 1, 2019, checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled $ 11.2 million and $ 6.2 million, respectively. 44

--- PAGE 45 ---
Table of Contents Investment Securities Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments-Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months as available-for-sale. We classified these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations.  Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined on the specific identification method. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Trade Receivables We record trade receivables at net realizable value, which includes an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. At May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts were $ 744 thousand and $ 206 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based upon an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and credit history. Although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal, we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts. In circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings), a reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debt based on the length of time the receivables are aged, generally 100% for amounts aged more than 60 days. Collateral is generally not required. Credit losses have consistently been within management’s expectations. At both May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019 one customers accounted for approximately 29.5 % and 29.6 % of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively. Inventories Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The cost associated with flocks, consisting principally of chicks, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during a growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over the productive lives of the flocks, generally one to two years. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. The Company does not disclose the gross cost and accumulated amortization with respect to its flock inventories since this information is not utilized by management in the operation of the Company. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property, plant, and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant, and equipment as part of the asset to which it relates, and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. 45

Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement and classifies it as an operating lease or finance lease. We recognize the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term as a right-of-use ("ROU") asset on our balance sheet. A lease liability is recorded to represent our obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. These assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Finance lease right-of-use asset, Operating lease right-of-use asset, Current portion of finance lease obligation, Current portion of operating lease obligation, Long-term finance lease obligation, and Long-term operating lease obligation. The Company records ROU assets and lease obligations based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. When the rate implicit in the lease is not easily determinable, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to calculate the present value of the future lease payments. The Company elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease obligations for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Nature of Leases The company leases certain office spaces, trucks, processing machines, and equipment to support our operations under cancelable and non-cancelable contracts. Corporate and Field Offices We lease office space for administrative employees at some of our farms. These contracts are typically structured with initial non-cancelable terms of three to ten years . To the extent our corporate and field office contracts include renewal options, we evaluate whether we are reasonably certain to exercise those options on a contract by contract basis based on expected future office space needs. Trucks We assumed several non-cancelable operating leases for trucks from a prior acquisition. The initial terms on these leases ranged from five to seven years . We do not intend to exercise renewal options beyond the initial term. Processing machines and other equipment We lease a processing machine through a finance lease arrangement assumed in an acquisition. The lease contains a purchase option at the end of the term that we intend to exercise. The company leases various pieces of equipment such as forklifts, pallet jacks, and other items in support of operations. These leases are cancelable and non-cancelable with remaining terms ranging from one month to five years . 46

Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has a 20% to 50% interest in other entities or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these entities. Nonmarketable investments in which the Company has less than a 20% interest and in which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are initially recorded at cost, and periodically reviewed for impairment. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. Intangible Assets Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. Accrued Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Treasury Stock Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The grant of restricted stock through the Company’s share-based compensation plans is funded through the issuance of treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares in accordance with the Company’s share-based compensation plans are credited or charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value using the average-cost method. Revenue Recognition and Delivery Costs Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 1 4 , Revenue Recognition , for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. 47

Table of Contents Advertising Costs The Company expensed advertising costs as incurred of $ 6.0 million, $ 7.3 million, and $ 6.3 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s policy with respect to evaluating uncertain tax positions is based upon whether management believes it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained upon review by the taxing authorities. The tax positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company shall initially and subsequently measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Based upon management’s assessment, there are no uncertain tax positions expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Stock Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 1 6 - Stock Compensation Plans for more information. Business Combinations The Company applies fair value accounting guidance to measure non-financial assets and liabilities associated with business acquisitions. These assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for the initial purchase price allocation and are subject to recurring revaluations. The fair value of non-financial assets acquired is determined internally. Our internal valuation methodology for non-financial assets takes into account the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets. Loss Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. 48

Table of Contents The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. The purpose of the standard is to improve transparency and comparability related to the accounting and reporting of leasing arrangements. The new standard establishes a ROU model that requires a lessee to recognize a ROU asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statement of income. The effective date for the new standard, for the Company, was June 2, 2019 and the Company adopted the new standard on that date. The Company elected a modified retrospective transition approach, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We used June 2, 2019 as the date of initial application. If an entity chooses the second option, the transition requirements for existing leases apply to leases entered into between the date of initial application and the effective date. The entity must recast its comparative period financial statements and provide the disclosures required by the new standard for the comparative periods. Because the Company chose the first option, the Company has not recast its comparative period financial statements. In connection with adopting the new standard, the Company reclassified its presentation of finance lease obligations and property in the financial statements for all periods presented. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company elected practical expedients which permit us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The new standard provides practical expedients for an entity’s initial and ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. For the leases that qualify, we do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, and this includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition. We also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases. Implementation of the new standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. As a result, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units’ fair value. The guidance is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, our fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017, and the prospective transition method should be applied. We elected to early adopt the standard effective for our annual impairment tests in fiscal 2020, which did not have an impact on our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, our fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, our fiscal 2020. The application of the guidance requires various transition methods depending on the specific amendment. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 49

Table of Contents In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. This standard will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, our fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The application of the guidance requires various transition methods depending on the specific amendment and the prospective transition method should be applied. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20) Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans, which modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans. The guidance removes disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial and adds new, as well as clarifies certain other, disclosure requirements. This standard will be effective in fiscal years after December 15, 2020, our fiscal 2021, with the option to early adopt at any time prior to the effective date, and it will require adoption on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Reclassification Certain reclassifications were made to the fiscal 2019 financial statements to conform to the fiscal 2020 financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on income. Note 2 - Acquisitions Effective on October 20, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets of Mahard Egg Farm ("Mahard"), relating to its commercial shell egg production, processing, distribution and sales for $ 45.5 million. The acquired assets include facilities with current capacity for approximately 3.9 million laying hens and permitted capacity for up to 8.0 million laying hens, a feed mill, pullet raising facilities and related production facilities located in Chillicothe, Texas, and Nebo, Oklahoma, a distribution warehouse located in Gordonville, Texas and an equity interest in Texas Egg Products, LLC ("TEP"). As a result of the acquisition, the Company acquired a 21.1 % equity interest in TEP which brought our total ownership to 93.2 %. The acquired operations of Mahard are included in the accompanying financial statements as of October 20, 2019.

Gross realized gains on those sales and maturities during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $ 611,000 , $ 48,000 , and $ 23,000 , respectively. There were no realized losses for the fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Note 4 - Fair Value Measures The Company is required to categorize both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable, and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. • Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including: ◦ Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets ◦ Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets ◦ Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ◦ Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data • Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities The disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Long-term debt and lease obligations: The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt and lease obligations is at its stated value which approximates fair value. ໿ Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019 (in thousands): ໿ May 30, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Balance Assets Municipal bonds $ — $ 16,179 $ — $ 16,179 Commercial paper — 6,982 — 6,982 Corporate bonds — 126,868 — 126,868 Certificates of deposits — 1,492 — 1,492 Asset backed securities — 2,642 — 2,642 Mutual funds 2,749 — — 2,749 Total assets measured at fair value $ 2,749 $ 154,163 $ — $ 156,912 52

Observable inputs for these securities are yields, credit risks, default rates, and volatility. Note 5 - Inventories Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): ໿ May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Flocks, net of amortization $ 110,198 $ 105,536 Eggs and egg products 18,487 14,318 Feed and supplies 58,531 52,383 $ 187,216 $ 172,237 We grow and maintain flocks of layers (mature female chickens), pullets (female chickens under 18 weeks of age), and breeders (male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to hatch for egg production flocks). Our total flock at May 30, 2020, consisted of approximately 10.7 million pullets and breeders and 40.1 million layers.

--- PAGE 54 ---
Table of Contents Depreciation expense was $ 54.5 million, $ 51.7 million and $ 51.1 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company maintains insurance for both property damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic events, such as fires. Insurance recoveries received for property damage and business interruption in excess of the net book value of damaged assets, clean-up and demolition costs, and post-event costs are recognized as income in the period received or committed when all contingencies associated with the recoveries are resolved. Gains on insurance recoveries related to business interruption are recorded within “Cost of sales” and any gains or losses related to property damage are recorded within “(Gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets.” Insurance recoveries related to business interruption are classified as operating cash flows and recoveries related to property damage are classified as investing cash flows in the statement of cash flows. Insurance claims incurred or finalized during the fiscal years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Included in cost of sales for fiscal 2020 is a non-cash impairment loss on fixed assets of $ 2.9 million related to decommissioning some older, less efficient production facilities as the Company continues to invest in new facilities to meet the increasing demand for specialty eggs and reduce production costs. Note 7 - Investment in Unconsolidated Entities The Company has several investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC ("Red River") operates a cage-free shell egg production complex near Bogota, Texas. Specialty Eggs, LLC ("Specialty Eggs") owns the Egg-Land's Best franchise for most of Georgia and South Carolina, as well as a portion of western North Carolina and eastern Alabama. Southwest Specialty Eggs, LLC ("Southwest Specialty Eggs") owns the Egg-Land's Best franchise for Arizona, southern California and Clark County, Nevada (including Las Vegas). As of May 30, 2020, the Company owns 50 % in Red River, Specialty Eggs, and Southwest Specialty Eggs. Equity method investments are included in “Investments in unconsolidated entities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $ 54.7 million and $ 60.7 million at May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, respectively. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities of $ 534 thousand, $ 4.8 million, and $ 3.5 million from these entities has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Table of Contents The following table presents the total estimated amortization of intangible assets for the five succeeding years (in thousands): ໿ For fiscal period Estimated amortization expense 2021 $ 2,503 2022 2,199 2023 2,199 2024 2,170 2025 2,041 Thereafter 10,984 Total $ 22,096 ໿ Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains a medical plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to tax under present income tax laws. The plan is funded by contributions from the Company and its employees. Under its plan, the Company self-insures its portion of medical claims for substantially all full-time employees. The Company uses stop-loss insurance to limit its portion of medical claims to $ 225,000 per occurrence. The Company's expenses including accruals for incurred but not reported claims were approximately $ 17.8 million, $ 18.1 million, and $ 16.1 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The liability recorded for incurred but not reported claims was $ 1.7 million and $ 1.1 million as of May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, respectively. The Company has a KSOP plan that covers substantially all employees (“the Plan”). The Company makes contributions to the Plan at a rate of 3 % of participants' eligible compensation, plus an additional amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Contributions can be made in cash or the Company's common stock, and vest immediately. The Company's cash contributions to the Plan were $ 3.8 million, $ 3.7 million, and $ 3.3 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company did not make direct contributions of the Company’s common stock in fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018. Dividends on the Company’s common stock are paid to the Plan in cash. The Plan acquires the Company’s common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ, by using the dividends and the Company’s cash contribution to purchase shares in the public markets. The Plan sells common stock on the NASDAQ to pay benefits to Plan participants. Participants may make contributions to the Plan up to the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service regulations. The Company does not match participant contributions. The Company has deferred compensation agreements with certain officers for payments to be made over specified periods beginning when the officers reach age 65 or over as specified in the agreements. Amounts accrued for the agreements are based upon deferred compensation earned over the estimated remaining service period of each officer. Payments made under the plan were $ 150,000 , $ 129,000 , and $ 110,000 in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The liability recorded related to these agreements was $ 1.4 million and $ 1.5 million at May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, respectively. In December 2006, the Company adopted an additional deferred compensation plan to provide deferred compensation to named officers of the Company. The awards issued under this plan were $ 266,000 , $ 267,000 , and $ 298,000 in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Payments made under the plan were $ 1.2 million and $ 84,000 in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The liability recorded related to this plan was $ 2.7 million and $ 3.4 million at May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019, respectively. Deferred compensation expense for both plans totaled $ 621,000 , $ 377,000 and $ 693,000 in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 56

Table of Contents Postretirement Medical Plan The Company maintains an unfunded postretirement medical plan to provide limited health benefits to certain qualified retired employees and officers. Retired non-officers and spouses are eligible for coverage until attainment of Medicare eligibility, at which time coverage ceases. Retired officers and spouses are eligible for lifetime benefits under the plan. Officers and their spouses, who retired prior to May 1, 2012, must participate in Medicare Plans A and B. Officers, and their spouses, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. The plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits, whereby an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, this expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employees’ approximate period of employment. The liability associated with the plan was $ 3.4 million at May 30, 2020 and $ 2.9 million June 1, 2019. The remaining disclosures associated with ASC 715 are immaterial to the Company’s financial statements. Note 10 - Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt As of June 1, 2019, the Company had a $ 1.5 million outstanding note payable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company retired all outstanding long-term debt, and as of May 30, 2020, had no outstanding long-term debt. For the fiscal years ending 2020, 2019 and 2018, interest, net of amount capitalized, was $ 498 thousand, $ 644 thousand, and $ 265 thousand, respectively. No interest was capitalized during fiscal 2020 and 2019.  $ 217 thousand of interest was capitalized for construction of certain facilities during fiscal 2018. On July 10, 2018, we entered into a $ 100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a five -year term. The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature permitting the Company, with the consent of the administrative agent, to increase the revolving commitments in the aggregate up to $ 125.0 million. No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of May 30, 2020 or during fiscal 2020. The Company had $ 4.3 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at May 30, 2020. The interest rate is based, at the Company’s election, on either the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Eurodollar Rate” means the reserve adjusted rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three, six or twelve months (as selected by the Company) are quoted. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the administrative agent, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 % per annum, subject to certain interest rate floors. The “Applicable Margin” means 0 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case depending upon the average outstanding balance at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee of 0.2 % on the unused portion of the facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by all the current and future wholly-owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and is secured by a first-priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ accounts, payment intangibles, instruments (including promissory notes), chattel paper, inventory (including farm products) and deposit accounts maintained with the administrative agent. The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of liens, and additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes and investments. The credit agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants (i) a minimum working capital ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and (ii) an annual limit on capital expenditures of $ 150.0 million. Additionally, the credit agreement requires that Fred R. Adams Jr., his spouse, natural children, sons-in-law or grandchildren, or any trust, guardianship, 57

Table of Contents conservatorship or custodianship for the primary benefit of any of the foregoing, or any family limited partnership, similar limited liability company or other entity that 100% of the voting control of such entity is held by any of the foregoing, shall maintain at least 50 % of the Company’s voting stock. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the credit agreement. Further, dividends are restricted to the Company’s current dividend policy of one-third of the Company’s net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is allowed to repurchase up to $ 75.0 million of its capital stock in any year provided there is no default under the credit agreement and the Company has availability of at least $ 20.0 million under the facility. The credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due and foreclosure of the collateral. At May 30, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Revolving Credit Facility. Note 11 - Accrued Dividends Payable and Dividends per Common Share We accrue dividends at the end of each quarter according to the Company’s dividend policy adopted by its Board of Directors. The Company pays a dividend to shareholders of its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock on a quarterly basis for each quarter for which the Company reports net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. computed in accordance with GAAP in an amount equal to one-third (1/3) of such quarterly income. Dividends are paid to shareholders of record as of the 60 th day following the last day of such quarter, except for the fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarter, the Company pays dividends to shareholders of record on the 65 th day after the quarter end. Dividends are payable on the 15 th day following the record date. Following a quarter for which the Company does not report net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the Company will not pay a dividend for a subsequent profitable quarter until the Company is profitable on a cumulative basis computed from the date of the last quarter for which a dividend was paid. At the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the amount of cumulative losses to be recovered before payment of a dividend was $ 1.4 million. On our consolidated statement of income, we determine dividends per common share in accordance with the computation in the following table (in thousands, except per share data): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. $ 60,463 $ ( 19,761 ) $ 18,391 $ 54,229 Cumulative losses to be recovered prior to payment of divided at beginning of period ( 61,833 ) — ( 19,761 ) — Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend $ — $ — $ — $ 54,229 1/3 of net income attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend $ — Common stock outstanding (shares) 43,974 Class A common stock outstanding (shares) 4,800 Total common stock outstanding (shares) 48,774 Dividends per common share* $ — $ — $ — $ 0.506 *Dividends per common share = 1/3 of Net income (loss) attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. available for dividend ÷ Total common stock outstanding (shares). 58

Table of Contents Note 12 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's certificate of incorporation, holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company’s Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”) identifies family members of Mr. Adams (“Immediate Family Members”) and arrangements and entities that are permitted to receive and hold shares of Class A Common Stock, with ten votes per share, without such shares converting into shares of Common Stock, with one vote per share (“Permitted Transferees”). The Permitted Transferees include arrangements and entities such as revocable trusts and limited liability companies that could hold Class A Common Stock for the benefit of Immediate Family Members. Each Permitted Transferee must have a relationship, specifically defined in the Restated Charter, with another Permitted Transferee or an Immediate Family Member. A share of Class A Common Stock transferred to a person other than a Permitted Transferee would automatically convert into Common Stock with one vote per share. Additionally, the Restated Charter includes a sunset provision pursuant to which all of the outstanding Class A Common Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock if: (a) less than 4,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees, or (b) if less than 4,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees. Note 13 - Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine is based on the weighted average Common Stock and Class A Common Stock outstanding.

Basic $ 0.38 $ 1.12 $ 2.60 Diluted $ 0.38 $ 1.12 $ 2.60 Note 14 - Revenue Recognition Satisfaction of Performance Obligation The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from agreements with customers based on the customer placing an order for products. Pricing for the most part is determined when the Company and the customer agree upon the specific order, which establishes the contract for that order. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 52.2 million, $ 53.6 million, and $ 53.2 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Returns and Refunds Some of our contracts include a guaranteed sale clause, pursuant to which we credit the customer’s account for product that the customer is unable to sell before expiration. The Company records an estimate of returns and refunds by using historical return data and comparing to current period sales and accounts receivable. The allowance is recorded as a reduction in sales with a corresponding reduction in trade accounts receivable. Sales Incentives Provided to Customers The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. 60

Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ Disaggregation of Revenue The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Conventional shell egg sales $ 311,380 $ 150,860 $ 830,278 $ 810,306 Specialty shell egg sales 133,347 119,892 485,465 504,169 Egg products 7,204 8,852 31,414 41,508 Other 1,402 968 4,452 5,205 $ 453,333 $ 280,572 $ 1,351,609 $ 1,361,188 Contract Costs The Company can incur costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. The amortization period of these costs is less than one year; therefore, they are expensed as incurred. Contract Balances The Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from delivery. There are rarely contract assets or liabilities related to performance under the contract. Concentration of Credit Risks Our largest customer, Walmart Inc. (including Sam's Club) accounted for 32.1 %, 33.7 % and 33.2 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. H-E-B, LP accounted for 10.1 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 2020. Note 15 - Leases Expenses related to operating leases, amortization of finance lease ROU assets and finance lease interest are included in Cost of sales, Selling general and administrative expense, and Interest income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The purpose of the 2012 Plan is to assist us and our subsidiaries in attracting and retaining selected individuals who, serving as our employees, outside directors and consultants, are expected to contribute to our success and to achieve long-term objectives which will benefit our shareholders through the additional incentives inherent in the awards under the 2012 Plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2012 Plan is 1,000,000 shares issuable from the Company’s treasury stock. Awards may be granted under the 2012 Plan to any employee, any non-employee member of the Company’s Board of Directors, and any consultant who is a natural person and provides services to us or one of our subsidiaries (except for incentive stock options which may be granted only to our employees). The only outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan are restricted stock awards. The restricted stock vests three years from the grant date, or upon death or disability, change in control, or retirement (subject to certain requirements). The restricted stock contains no other service or performance conditions. Restricted stock is awarded in the name of the recipient and except for the right of disposal, constitutes issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock for all corporate purposes during the period of restriction including the right to receive dividends. Compensation expense is a fixed amount based on the grant date closing price and is amortized over the vesting period. Our unrecognized compensation expense as a result of non-vested shares was $ 6.3 million at May 30, 2020 and $ 6.0 million June 1, 2019. The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized to stock compensation expense over a period of 2.08 years. The Company recognized stock compensation expense of $ 3.6 million, $ 3.6 million, and $ 3.5 million for equity awards in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. 62

The CARES Act contains several income tax provisions, as well as other measures, that are intended to assist businesses impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant provision of the CARES Act that will materially affect our accounting for income taxes includes a five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in tax years 2018 through 2020, our fiscal years 2019 through 2021. Previously, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, disallowed the carrying back of taxable net operating losses to offset prior years’ taxable income. Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 were materially affected by the changes enacted by the CARES Act. U.S. GAAP requires that the effects from changes in tax laws be recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted, which for the CARES Act is the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result of the applicable accounting guidance and the provisions enacted by the CARES Act, our income tax provision for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 reflects the carryback of taxable net operating losses generated during periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 21% to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 64

--- PAGE 65 ---
Table of Contents 35%. Due to the difference in statutory rates, we recorded a $ 3.0 million discrete income tax benefit related to the carryback provisions during the thirteen weeks ended May 30, 2020. Because the net operating losses were carried back to years in which we initially reduced our taxable income using the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, we recorded a partially offsetting $ 684 thousand discrete income tax expense during the thirteen weeks ended May 30, 2020 to account for the reduced taxable income. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015. Although we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions within the U.S., we are currently not under audit by any state and local tax authorities. As of May 30, 2020, the IRS has proposed adjustments related to the Company’s research and development credits claimed during the years under audit. Management is currently evaluating those proposed adjustments and does not anticipate the adjustments would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $ 453 thousand in previously recognized tax benefits related to research and development credits may be necessary within the coming year. Tax periods for all years beginning with fiscal year 2013 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies Financial Instruments The Company maintained standby letters of credit ("LOC") totaling $ 4.3 million at May 30, 2020, which were issued under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding LOCs are for the benefit of certain insurance companies. None of the LOCs are recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC On April 23, 2020, the Company and Wharton County Foods, LLC (“WCF”) were named as defendants in State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The State of Texas (“the State”) has asserted claims based on the Company’s and WCF’s alleged violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices—Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 17.41-17.63 (“DTPA”). The State claims that the Company and WCF offered shell eggs at excessive or exorbitant prices during the COVID-19 state of emergency and made misleading statements about shell egg prices. The State seeks temporary and permanent injunctions against the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $ 100,000 in damages. The Company and WCF have filed initial responsive pleadings and will soon file a motion to dismiss. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al. On April 30, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-461, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. The defendants include numerous grocery stores, retailers, producers, and farms. Plaintiffs assert that defendants violated the DTPA by allegedly demanding exorbitant or excessive prices for eggs during the state of emergency. Plaintiffs request certification of a class of all consumers who purchased eggs in Texas sold, distributed, produced, or handled by any of the defendants during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from selling eggs at a price more than 10% greater than the price of eggs prior to the declaration of emergency and damages in the amount of $ 10,000 per violation, or $ 250,000 for each violation impacting anyone over 65 years old. This case is in the

Table of Contents early stages, and no responsive pleading has been filed at this point. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Fraser et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. et al. On April 20, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Fraser et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:20-cv-2733, in the Northern District of California. The defendants include numerous grocery stores, retailers, producers, and farms. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated the California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. (“UCL”), by unjustifiably raising the price of eggs by more than 10% during the declared state of emergency. Plaintiffs request class certification of all consumers who purchased eggs in California sold, distributed, produced, or handled by any of the defendants during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from selling eggs at a price more than 10% greater than the price of eggs prior to the declaration of emergency along with over $ 5,000,000 in damages. This case is in the early stages, and no responsive pleading has been filed at this point. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and The Kellogg Company. On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. No schedule has yet been entered by the court, but it appears likely that the case will be tried during 2021. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that does not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, but the court has not yet entered a judgment on the filing. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following among others: the matter is in the early stages of preparing for trial following remand; any trial will be before a different judge and jury in a different court than prior related cases; there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and there are requests for damages other than compensatory damages ( i.e. , injunction and treble money damages). 66

Table of Contents State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc. and affiliates, Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc. and its affiliate, George’s, Inc. and its affiliate, Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages has been dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief unless the court orders substantial affirmative remediation. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100% of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. The trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. The case was tried without a jury, and the court has not yet issued its ruling. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Other Matters In addition to the above, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Note 19 - Related Party Transaction At a special meeting on July 20, 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation in order to facilitate estate planning for the Company's founder and Chairman Emeritus, Mr. Fred R. Adams, Jr. The Company incurred legal and other fees in conjunction with these amendments. In connection with the negotiations relating to these amendments, Mr. Adams, through a conservatorship of which Mrs. Jean Reed Adams (the spouse of Mr. Adams) and Mr. Adolphus B. Baker (our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board) at the time were co-conservators, reimbursed the Company $ 750,000 of these fees in fiscal 2019.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures conducted by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together with other financial officers, such officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 30, 2020 at the reasonable assurance level. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The following sets forth, in accordance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 308 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K, the report of management on our internal control over financial reporting. 1. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. “Internal control over financial reporting” is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together with other financial officers, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: • Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; • Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 2. Our management, in accordance with Rule 13a-15(c) under the Exchange Act and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together with other financial officers, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 30, 2020. The framework on which management’s evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting is based 69
