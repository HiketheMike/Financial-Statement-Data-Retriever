MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISK FACTORS; FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS For information relating to important risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, securities, financial condition or operating results, reference is made to the disclosure set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors . In addition, because the following discussion includes numerous forward-looking statements relating to us, our results of operations, financial condition and business, reference is made to the information set forth in the section of Part I immediately preceding Item 1 above under the caption “ Forward-Looking Statements .” COMPANY OVERVIEW Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of fresh shell eggs. Our fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to May 31. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. In fiscal 2021, we sold approximately 1,073.2 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 19% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 37.8 million layers and 10.8 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. We sell most of our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors, and egg product consumers in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. Many of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and conventional eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products. We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage-free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as conventional products. While we report separate sales information for these types of eggs, there are a number of cost factors which are not specifically available for conventional or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. For further description of our business, refer to Part I. Item I. Business . COVID-19 Since early 2020, the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak, characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets. We understand the challenges and difficult economic environment facing families in the communities where we live and work, and we are committed to helping where we can. We have provided food assistance to those in need by donating approximately 2.5 million dozen eggs in fiscal 2021. We believe we are taking all reasonable precautions in the management of our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees, who work hard every day to produce eggs for our customers. As part of the nation’s food supply, we work in a critical infrastructure industry, and we believe we have a special responsibility to maintain our normal work schedule. As such, we are in regular communication with our managers across our operations and continue to closely monitor the situation in our facilities and in the communities where we live and work. We have implemented procedures designed to protect our employees, taking into account guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and other government health agencies, and we have strict sanitation protocols and biosecurity measures in place throughout our operations with restricted access to visitors. All non-essential corporate travel has been suspended. There are no known indications that COVID-19 affects hens or can be transferred through the food supply. We continue to proactively monitor and manage operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including additional related costs that we incurred or may incur in the future. The pandemic had a negative impact on our business through disruptions in the supply chain such as increased costs and availability of packaging supplies, increased labor costs and medical costs. In fiscal 2021, we spent $2.3 million (excluding medical insurance claims) related to the pandemic. The majority these expenses resulted from additional labor and increased cost of packaging materials, primarily reflected in cost of sales. Medical insurance claims related to COVID-19 paid during fiscal 2021 were an additional $1.4 million.

Table of Contents 22 Executive Overview of Results – Fiscal Years Ended May 29, 2021, May 30, 2020 and June 1, 2019 Fiscal Years Ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Net sales (in thousands) $ 1,348,987 $ 1,351,609 $ 1,361,188 Gross profit (in thousands) $ 160,661 $ 179,588 $ 222,859 Net average shell egg price (a) $ 1.217 $ 1.231 $ 1.265 Average UB Southeast Region - Shell Eggs - White Large $ 1.155 $ 1.220 $ 1.229 Feed costs per dozen produced $ 0.446 $ 0.409 $ 0.415 (a) The net average shell egg selling price is the blended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2019, an increase in the U.S flock size resulted in an oversupply of eggs, particularly from the start of our third quarter of fiscal 2019 through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This led to lower selling prices for conventional eggs, and demand for specialty eggs was negatively impacted by the low conventional egg prices. Our net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased $2.6 million compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the decrease in the selling price and volume of conventional eggs, partially offset by the increased volume of specialty eggs sold. We sell the majority of our conventional eggs at prices that take into account, in varying ways, independently quoted wholesale market prices as published by UB for shell eggs. The daily average of the UB Southeast Region – Shell Eggs – White Large decreased 5.3% during our fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The total number of shell eggs produced in the U.S. for fiscal 2021 was 2.0% less than the same period last year as reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). Hen numbers reported by the USDA as of June 1, 2021, were 315.7 million, which represents 5.3 million fewer hens than a year ago. Notably, this is the lowest national supply of laying hens since October 2016. However, we believe the decreased demand in foodservice seen throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic contributed to the depressed price of shell eggs in the retail market due to the extra supply entering the retail channel from the foodservice channel. The pandemic continues to affect the demand for shell eggs. During the early restrictive phase of the pandemic, which occurred during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, demand increased substantially as consumers were preparing for more meals at home. Consumer demand maintained a steady growth throughout our first three quarters of fiscal 2021 but began trending down during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as consumers started to resume pre-pandemic activities. Foodservice demand has started to improve, though it has remained below pre-pandemic levels. Our experience appears consistent with industry trends during this period. According to data provided by Informational Resources, Inc. (“IRi”), IRi’s Total US – Multi Outlet for all shell eggs demand increased by approximately 6% for the first three quarters during our fiscal year and decreased approximately 20% during our fourth fiscal quarter as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020. According to IRi Total U.S. – Multi Outlet data, for the 52 weeks ended May 30, 2021, dozens sold for conventional eggs decreased 3.4%, while dozens sold for specialty eggs increased 8.6% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, our total dozens sold for conventional eggs decreased 3.4%, while our total dozens sold for specialty eggs increased 12.5%, as compared to fiscal 2020. Specialty egg demand has historically been impacted by the price of the conventional egg. When the price of conventional eggs is low the demand for specialty eggs declines and as the price of conventional eggs increases the demand for specialty eggs increase. We have also seen demand for specialty eggs increases during holiday seasons. We believe that the increase in demand for specialty eggs has been affected since the onset of the pandemic as consumers have been preparing more meals at home rather than going out to eat, and therefore they have been more willing to spend money on specialty eggs. Gross profit decreased $18.9 million to $160.7 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease resulted primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs, as discussed above, and from increased feed costs. For fiscal year 2021, the average Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) daily market price was $3.77 per bushel for corn and $300.62 per ton for soybean meal, representing increases of 21.1% and 23.0%, respectively, compared to the daily average CBOT prices for fiscal 2020. Feed costs started trending higher midway through the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Increased export demand for both soybeans and corn, as well as weather- related shortfalls in production and yields, have placed additional pressure on domestic supplies, resulting in higher and more volatile prices. We continue to execute our growth strategy of remaining a low-cost provider of shell eggs and growth through selective acquisitions, with a focus on expanding cage-free capacity. Subsequent to fiscal 2021, we acquired the remaining 50%

Egg products net sales - Egg products net sales increased $5.3 million or 16.9%, primarily due to an increase in selling price of 21.2% compared to fiscal 2020, which had a $6.4 million positive impact on net sales. - Fiscal 2020 net average selling prices were negatively impacted by an oversupply of eggs throughout the first three quarters in fiscal 2020, followed by a decline in foodservice demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the pandemic. Our net average selling price has increased in fiscal 2021 as demand has started to increase in the foodservice channel. Table of Contents 25 COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists of costs directly related to producing, processing and packing shell eggs, purchases of shell eggs from outside producers, processing and packing of liquid and frozen egg products and other non-egg costs. Farm production costs are those costs incurred at the egg production facility, including feed, facility, hen amortization, and other related farm production costs. The following table presents the key variables affecting our cost of sales (in thousands, except cost per dozen data): Fiscal Year Ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 % Change Cost of Sales: Farm production $ 730,902 $ 677,181 7.9 % Processing, packaging, and warehouse 250,058 234,243 6.8 Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) 177,634 232,027 (23.4) Total shell eggs 1,158,594 1,143,451 1.3 Egg products 29,536 25,651 15.1 Other 196 2,919 (93.3) Total $ 1,188,326 $ 1,172,021 1.4 % Farm production costs (per dozen produced) Feed $ 0.446 $ 0.409 9.0 % Other $ 0.320 $ 0.329 (2.7) % Total $ 0.766 $ 0.738 3.8 % Outside egg purchases (average cost per dozen) $ 1.22 $ 1.26 (3.2) % Dozens produced 970,837 927,799 4.6 % Percent produced to sold 90.5% 86.8% 4.3 % Farm Production - Feed costs increased $53.7 million, primarily due to increased export demand, as well as weather-related shortfalls in production and yields, which have placed additional pressure on domestic supplies. - Other farm production costs decreased due to lower facility expense, resulting from improved efficiencies in our utilization and from increased volume of eggs produced. - We also had lower amortization expense, due to the lower feed costs in prior periods, which are capitalized in our flocks during pullet production. In fiscal 2020 we incurred higher amortization expense due to selling flocks early in response to market conditions. Processing, packaging, and warehouse - Processing costs increased due to a 3.2% increase in the volume of eggs processed. - Cost of pac kaging materials increased 3.0% as the retail channel demand increased due to the pandemic and manufacturers increased prices and implemented pandemic surcharges. - Labor costs increased 7.2% due to the pandemic, due to crisis pay and wage increases in response to labor shortages. Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) - Costs in this category decreased primarily due to the decrease in the volume of outside egg purchases, as our percentage of produced to sold increased to 90.5%, as well as a decrease in the cost of these purchases. Looking forward to fiscal 2022, we believe with the ongoing uncertainties and continued supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, weather fluctuations, increase demand for exports and geopolitical issues, that feed ingredients will remain higher in the near future and expect to see price volatility throughout the year. We do not anticipate problems in securing an adequate amount of feed ingredients for fiscal 2022.

Table of Contents 26 GROSS PROFIT Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 11.9% for fiscal 2021, compared to 13.3% for fiscal 2020. The decrease resulted primarily from lower selling prices for conventional eggs and increased feed costs. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SGA") include costs of marketing, distribution, accounting, and corporate overhead. The following table presents an analysis of our SGA expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 $ Change % Change Specialty egg expense $ 59,294 $ 49,237 $ 10,057 20.4 % Delivery expense 52,670 52,230 440 0.8 % Payroll, taxes and benefits 43,327 44,156 (829) (1.9) % Stock compensation expense 3,778 3,617 161 4.5 % Other expenses 24,874 28,997 (4,123) (14.2) % Total $ 183,943 $ 178,237 $ 5,706 3.2 % Specialty egg expense - Advertising and franchise fees increased due to the increased volume of specialty eggs sales of 12.5% along with increased promotional spending throughout the year as compared to the same period in the prior year. Other expenses - Other expenses decreased due to a legal settlement paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, in an amount that was not material. - In addition, for fiscal 2021 we received a return of brokerage commissions on property and casualty insurance placements. OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) As a result of the above, our operating loss was $26.3 million for fiscal 2021, compared to operating income of $1.3 million for fiscal 2020. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Total other income (expense) consists of items not directly charged to, or related to, operations such as interest income and expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated entities, and patronage dividends, among other items. The Company recorded interest income of $2.8 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $5.0 million in fiscal 2020. We recorded interest expense of $213 thousand and $498 thousand in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income resulted from significantly lower investment balances and lower interest rates. Patronage dividends, which represent distributions from our membership in Eggland's Best, Inc. ("EB"), decreased $1.1 million or 10.8%. Patronage dividends are paid once a year based on EB’s profits and its available cash. Equity in income from unconsolidated entities for fiscal 2021 was $622 thousand compared to $534 thousand for fiscal 2020. Other, net for fiscal 2021 was income of $4.1 million compared to $3.7 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by realized and unrealized gains in investment securities available-for-sale. INCOME TAXES On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted. The most significant provision of the CARES Act that materially affected the Company’s income taxes included the five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in the tax years 2018 through 2020, our fiscal years 2019 through 2021.

INCOME TAXES On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted. The most significant provision of the CARES Act that materially affected the Company’s income taxes included the five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in the tax years 2018 through 2020, our fiscal years 2019 through 2021. Table of Contents 27 The Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 disallowed the carrying back of taxable net operating losses to offset prior years’ taxable income. The CARES Act allows us to carry those losses generated or that may be generated during our fiscal years 2019 through 2021 back to offset taxable income recognized during the prior five years. The Company is electing to utilize that provision, which will provide additional liquidity in the form of an income tax refund currently estimated to be approximately $36.5 million. We believe we will receive the refund during our third fiscal quarter of 2022. Additionally, we recorded a total income tax benefit of approximately $12.4 million related to the carryback provisions during our fiscal year 2021. For more information regarding the income tax effects of the CARES Act, refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 17 – Income Taxes . For the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021, our pre-tax loss was $9.9 million, compared to pre-tax income of $20.1 million for fiscal 2020. We recorded an income tax benefit of $12.0 million for fiscal 2021, which includes the tax benefit of $12.4 million described above. Our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate increased to 120.8% from 8.6% in fiscal 2020, driven primarily by the net operating loss carryback provisions allowed under the CARES Act. Excluding the effects of the CARES Act, our income tax benefit was $2.2 million for fiscal 2021 with an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.7%. Income tax expense was $4.8 million for the comparable period of fiscal 2020, which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24.1%. At May 29, 2021, the Company had an income tax receivable of $42.5 million compared to $9.9 million at May 30, 2020. During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an income tax receivable of $36.5 million related to the decision to carryback fiscal 2021 taxable net operating losses to recover a portion of taxes paid in fiscal 2016. Additionally, we received $1.4 million in state tax refunds related to claims for refund previously filed with state taxing authorities. For the thirteen weeks ended May 29, 2021, our pretax loss was $12.2 million, and our income tax benefit was $7.9 million with an effective tax rate of 65.1%, including the impact of the CARES Act. Our income tax provision for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 reflects the carryback of taxable net operating losses generated during periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 21% to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 35%, as permitted by the CARES Act. Excluding the effects of the CARES Act, our income tax expense was $1.8 million with an adjusted effective tax rate of 15.4%. The low effective rate was primarily related to a $7.4 million income tax benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in connection with the CARES Act. Items causing our effective tax rate to differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% are state income taxes, certain federal tax credits and certain items included in income or loss for financial reporting purposes that are not included in taxable income or loss for income tax purposes, including tax exempt interest income, certain nondeductible expenses, and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2020 was a loss of $63 thousand. During fiscal 2020, we acquired the remaining 27.9% interest in our majority-owned subsidiary TEP. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. As a result of the above, net income for fiscal 2021 was $2.1 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, compared to $18.4 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share for fiscal 2020. Fiscal Year Ended May 30, 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 1, 2019 The discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 1, 2019 can be found in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's fiscal 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our working capital at May 29, 2021 was $303.5 million, compared to $429.1 million at May 30, 2020. The calculation of working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Our current ratio was 5.77 at May 29, 2021 compared to 5.60 at May 30, 2020. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Due to seasonal factors described Part I. Item I. Business – Seasonality , we generally expect our need for working capital to be highest in the fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively.

Table of Contents 28 We had no long-term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 and 2020. On July 10, 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of May 29, 2021, no amounts were borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. We have $4.1 million in outstanding standby letters of credit, which were issued under our Revolving Credit Facility for the benefit of certain insurance companies. Refer to Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Financial Statements, Note 10 – Credit Facility for further information regarding our long-term debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $26.1 million for fiscal year 2021 compared with $73.6 million for fiscal year 2020. Decreased gross profit margins resulting primarily from lower selling prices for shell eggs, and increased feed costs contributed greatly to our decrease in cash flow from operations. The increase in accounts receivables balance at fiscal 2021 compared to prior fiscal 2020 is due to the income tax receivable related to the CARES Act, which is expected to be received in our third quarter of fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, approximately $129.1 million was provided from the sale and maturity of investments securities available-for- sale, $88.3 million was used to purchase short-term investments and net payments of $6.7 million were received from investments in unconsolidated entities. Approximately $95.1 million was used to purchase or construct property, plant and equipment, most of which related to the expansion of our cage-free shell egg production capacity. Refer to the table of material construction projects presented below for additional information on purchases and construction of property, plant and equipment. The net result of these and other activities as of May 29, 2021 was a decrease in cash of $20.8 million from May 30, 2020. For fiscal 2020, approximately $204.3 million was provided from the sale and maturity of investments securities available-for- sale, $107.2 million was used to purchase short-term investments and net payments of $7.1 million were received from investments i n unconsolidated entities. We used $44.7 million to acquire Mahard and the remaining interest in TEP. Approximately $124.2 million was used to purchase or construct property, plant and equipment, most of which related to the expansion of our cage-free shell egg production capacity. Refer to the table of material construction projects presented below for additional information on purchases and construction of property, plant and equipment. We used $1.5 million for principal payments on long-term debt. The net result of these and other activities as of May 30, 2020 was an increase in cash of $8.9 million from June 1, 2019. We continue to monitor the increasing demand for cage-free eggs and to engage with our customers in an effort to achieve a smooth transition to meet their announced commitment timeline for cage-free egg sales. We have invested approximately $476 million in facilities, equipment and related operations to expand our cage-free production starting with our first facility in 2008, which includes the $48.5 million acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Red River discussed in Note 20 – Subsequent Events in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As we monitor the demand for cage-free eggs and our growth strategy described in Part I. Item I. Business – Growth Strategy, there may be a need for long-term debt financing. We believe with our strong balance sheet that we will have adequate access to capital markets if that need arises.

The following table presents current material construction projects approved as of May 29, 2021 (in thousands): Project(s) Type Projected Completion Projected Cost Spent as of May 29, 2021 Remaining Projected Cost Cage-Free Layer & Pullet Houses/Processing Facility Fiscal 2022 $ 140,876 $ 93,612 $ 47,264 $ 140,876 $ 93,612 $ 47,264 We believe our current cash balances, investments, cash flows from operations, and Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our current capital needs. As we monitor the demand for cage-free eggs and our growth strategy described in Part I. Item I. Business – Growth Strategy, there may be a need for long-term debt financing. We believe with our strong balance sheet that we will have adequate access to capital markets if that need arises.

Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Our critical accounting estimates are described below. INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months, as available-for-sale. We classify these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. The Company extends credit to customers based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition and credit history. Collateral is generally not required. The Company minimizes exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. In determining our reserve for credit losses, receivables are pooled according to age, with each pool assigned an expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors.

Table of Contents 30 INVENTORIES Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. If market prices for eggs and feed grains move substantially lower, we record adjustments to write down the carrying values of eggs and feed inventories to fair market value. The cost associated with flock inventories, consisting principally of chick purchases, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during the growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Capitalized flock costs are then amortized over the flock’s productive life, generally one to two years. Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. High mortality from disease or extreme temperatures will result in abnormal write-downs to flock inventories. Management continually monitors each flock and attempts to take appropriate actions to minimize the risk of mortality loss. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Depreciable long-lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings, improvements, machinery and equipment. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. An increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense. When property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. We continually reevaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, for events or changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use. EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS We have invested in other companies engaged in the production, processing and distribution of shell eggs and egg products. These investments are recorded using the cost or equity method, and are not consolidated in our financial statements. Changes in the ownership percentages of these investments might alter the accounting methods currently used. Our investment in these companies is shown on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the amounts presented for "Investment in unconsolidated entities" and “Other long-term assets”. GOODWILL Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment.

See Note 14 – Revenue Recognition in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. SALES INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ STOCK BASED COMPENSATION We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 16 – Stock Compensation Plans in Part II. Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. INCOME TAXES We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities. Any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS COMMODITY PRICE RISK Our primary exposure to market risk arises from changes in the prices of conventional eggs, which are subject to significant price fluctuations that are largely beyond our control. We are focused on growing our specialty shell egg business because the selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally not as volatile as conventional shell egg prices. Our exposure to market risk also includes changes in the prices of corn and soybean meal, which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations due to market conditions that are largely beyond our control. To ensure continued availability of feed ingredients, we may enter into contracts for future purchases of corn and soybean meal, and as part of these contracts, we may lock-in the basis portion of our grain purchases several months in advance. Ordinarily, we do not enter long-term contracts beyond a year to purchase corn and soybean meal or hedge against increases in the price of corn and soybean meal. The following table outlines the impact of price changes for corn and soybean meal on feed costs per dozen as feed ingredient pricing varies: Change in price per bushel of corn $ (0.87) $ (0.58) $ (0.29) $ 0.00 $ 0.29 $ 0.58 $ 0.87 Change in price per ton Soybean Meal $ (82.50) 0.386 0.396 0.406 0.416 0.426 0.436 0.446 $ (55.00) 0.396 0.406 0.416 0.426 0.436 0.446 0.456 $ (27.50) 0.406 0.416 0.426 0.436 0.446 0.456 0.466 $ 0.00 0.416 0.426 0.436 0.446 (a) 0.456 0.466 0.476 $ 27.50 0.426 0.436 0.446 0.456 0.466 0.476 0.486 $ 55.00 0.436 0.446 0.456 0.466 0.476 0.486 0.496 $ 82.50 0.446 0.456 0.466 0.476 0.486 0.496 0.506 (a) Based on 2021 actual costs, table flexes feed cost inputs to show $0.01 impacts to per dozen egg feed production costs. INTEREST RATE RISK The fair value of our debt is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In July 2018, we entered into a $100.0 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility which bears interest at a variable rate. No amounts were outstanding under that facility during fiscal 2021. Under our current policies, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES RISK At May 29, 2021, the effective maturity of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale was 11.2 months, and the composite credit rating of the holdings are A- / A3 / A- (S&P / Moody’s / Fitch). CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Our financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas, except that at May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, 23.8% and 29.5%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. (including Sam’s Club). No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 29, 2021, and the related consolidated notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(1) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 29, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2021, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company records liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2021, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Contingent Liabilities – Litigation and Claims – Refer to Note 18 in the Consolidated Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company records liabilities for legal proceedings and claims in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings and claims even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Table of Contents 34 We identified litigation and claims as a critical audit matter because of the challenges auditing management’s judgments applied in determining the likelihood of loss related to the resolution of such claims. Specifically, auditing management’s determination of whether any contingent loss arising from the related litigation and claims is probable, reasonably possible or remote, and the related disclosures, is subjective and requires significant judgment due to the sensitivity of the issue. How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed during the Audit Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of the controls relating to the Company’s evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings and claims, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures over the legal proceedings and claims. These procedures also included obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of the Company’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s disclosures related to legal proceedings and claims and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s legal contingencies. /s/ Frost, PLLC We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.

(“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the production, grading, packing and sale of fresh shell eggs, including cage-free, organic, and nutritionally-enhanced eggs. The Company, which is headquartered in Ridgeland, Mississippi, is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States and sells the majority of its shell eggs in states across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries, and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Fiscal Year The Company’s fiscal year-end is on the Saturday closest to May 31. Each of the year-to-date periods ended May 29, 2021 , May 30, 2020, and June 1, 2019, included 52 weeks. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and may change materially in future periods. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain bank accounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The Company routinely maintains cash balances with certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced any loss in such accounts. The Company manages this risk through maintaining cash deposits and other highly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts to which funds are moved, and zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding accounts payable. Checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances, which are included in accounts payable. At May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled $ 7.5 million and $ 11.2 million, respectively. Investment Securities Our investment securities are accounted for in accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt and Equity Securities” (“ASC 320”). The Company considers its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's ability to sell within the next 12 months, as available-for-sale. We classify these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The Company regularly evaluates changes to the rating of its debt securities by credit agencies and economic conditions to assess and record any expected credit losses through allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. The cost basis for realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is determined by the specific identification method. Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Gains and losses are recognized in other income (expenses) as Other, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in mutual funds are classified as “Other long-term assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Table of Contents 41 Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at their carrying values, which include a reserve for credit losses. At May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, reserves for credit losses were $ 795 thousand and $ 744 thousand, respectively. The Company extends credit to customers based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition and credit history. Collateral is generally not required. The Company minimizes exposure to counter party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures. In determining our reserve for credit losses, receivables are pooled according to age, with each pool assigned an expected loss based on historical loss information adjusted as needed for economic and other forward-looking factors. At both May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020 one customer accounted for approximately 23.8 % and 29.5 % of the Company’s trade accounts receivable, respectively. Inventories Inventories of eggs, feed, supplies and flocks are valued principally at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The cost associated with flocks, consisting principally of chicks, feed, labor, contractor payments and overhead costs, are accumulated during a growing period of approximately 22 weeks. Flock costs are amortized to cost of sales over the productive lives of the flocks, generally one to two years . Flock mortality is charged to cost of sales as incurred. The Company does not disclose the gross cost and accumulated amortization with respect to its flock inventories since this information is not utilized by management in the operation of the Company. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which are 15 to 25 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property, plant, and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property, plant, and equipment as part of the asset to which it relates, and is amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the arrangement and classifies it as an operating lease or finance lease. We recognize the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term as a right-of-use ("ROU") asset on our balance sheet. A lease liability is recorded to represent our obligation to make lease payments over the term of the lease. These assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Finance lease right-of-use asset, Operating lease right-of-use asset, Current portion of finance lease obligation, Current portion of operating lease obligation, Long-term finance lease obligation, and Long-term operating lease obligation. The Company records ROU assets and lease obligations based on the discounted future minimum lease payments over the term of the lease. When the rate implicit in the lease is not easily determinable, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to calculate the present value of the future lease payments. The Company elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease obligations for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities The equity method of accounting is used when the Company has a 20% to 50% interest in other entities or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the Company’s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these entities. Nonmarketable investments in which the Company has less than a 20% interest and in which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are initially recorded at cost, and periodically reviewed for impairment.

Nonmarketable investments in which the Company has less than a 20% interest and in which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee are initially recorded at cost, and periodically reviewed for impairment. Table of Contents 42 Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. After assessing the totality of events or circumstances, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform additional quantitative tests to determine the magnitude of any impairment. Intangible Assets Included in other intangible assets are separable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions, which include franchise fees, non-compete agreements and customer relationship intangibles. They are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to 15 years. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. Accrued Self Insurance We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Treasury Stock Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. The grant of restricted stock through the Company’s share-based compensation plans is funded through the issuance of treasury stock. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares in accordance with the Company’s share- based compensation plans are credited or charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value using the average-cost method. Revenue Recognition and Delivery Costs Revenue recognition is completed upon satisfaction of the performance obligation to the customer, which typically occurs within days of the Company and customer agreeing upon the order. See Note 14 – Revenue Recognition for further discussion of the policy. The Company believes the performance obligation is met upon delivery and acceptance of the product by our customers. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Sales revenue reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is reduced to reflect estimated returns and allowances. The Company records an estimated sales allowance for returns and discounts at the time of sale using historical trends based on actual sales returns and sales. Advertising Costs The Company expensed advertising costs as incurred of $ 11.7 million, $ 6.0 million, and $ 7.3 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s policy with respect to evaluating uncertain tax positions is based upon whether management believes it is more likely than not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained upon review by the taxing authorities. The tax positions must meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold with consideration given to the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement using the facts, circumstances and information at the reporting date. The Company will reflect only the portion of the tax benefit that will be sustained upon resolution of the position and applicable interest on the portion of the tax benefit not recognized. The Company initially and subsequently measures the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Based upon management’s assessment, there are no uncertain tax positions expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 43 Stock Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance-based shares, to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values. ASC 718 requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow. See Note 16 – Stock Compensation Plans for more information. Business Combinations The Company applies fair value accounting guidance to measure non-financial assets and liabilities associated with business acquisitions. These assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for the initial purchase price allocation and are subject to recurring revaluations. The fair value of non-financial assets acquired is determined internally. Our internal valuation methodology for non-financial assets takes into account the remaining estimated life of the assets acquired and what management believes is the market value for those assets. Loss Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. The Company expenses the costs of litigation as they are incurred. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies Effective May 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), which is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring more timely recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The guidance replaces the prior “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model and requires measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company adopted the guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company evaluated its current methodology of estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and the risk profile of its receivables portfolio and developed a model that includes the qualitative and forecasting aspects of the “expected loss” model under the amended guidance. The Company finalized its assessment of the impact of the amended guidance and recorded a $ 422 thousand cumulative increase to retained earnings at May 31, 2020. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Reclassification Certain reclassifications were made to the fiscal 2020 financial statements to conform to the fiscal 2021 financial statement presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on income. Note 2 – Acquisitions Effective on October 20, 2019, the Company acquired certain assets of Mahard Egg Farm ("Mahard"), relating to its commercial shell egg production, processing, distribution and sales for $ 45.5 million. The acquired assets include facilities with current

Note 4 - Fair Value Measures The Company is required to categorize both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable, and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. ● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities ● Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including: o Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets o Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets o Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability o Inputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data ● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities The disclosure of fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at cost are as follows: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable: The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. Lease obligations: The carrying value of the Company’s lease obligations is at its present value which approximates fair value. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020 (in thousands): May 29, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Balance Assets Municipal bonds $ — $ 16,480 $ — $ 16,480 Commercial paper — 1,998 — 1,998 Corporate bonds — 80,700 — 80,700 Certificates of deposits — 1,076 — 1,076 Asset backed securities — 11,904 — 11,904 Mutual funds 4,116 — — 4,116 Total assets measured at fair value $ 4,116 $ 112,158 $ — $ 116,274

Note 7 - Investment in Unconsolidated Entities At May 29, 2021, the Company had several investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Red River Valley Egg Farm, LLC ("Red River") operates a cage-free shell egg production complex near Bogota, Texas. Specialty Eggs, LLC ("Specialty Eggs") owns the Egg-Land's Best franchise for most of Georgia and South Carolina, as well as a portion of western North Carolina and eastern Alabama. Southwest Specialty Eggs, LLC ("Southwest Specialty Eggs") owns the Egg-Land's Best franchise for Arizona, southern California and Clark County, Nevada (including Las Vegas). As of May 29, 2021, the Company owned 50 % in Red River, Specialty Eggs, and Southwest Specialty Eggs. Equity method investments are included in “Investments in unconsolidated entities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $ 49.9 million and $ 54.7 million at May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, respectively. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities of $ 622 thousand, $ 534 thousand, and $ 4.8 million from these entities has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

At May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020, “Investments in unconsolidated entities” as shown on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the cost of the Company’s investment in EB plus any qualified written allocations. The Company cannot exert significant influence over EB’s operating and financial activities; therefore, the Company accounts for this investment using the cost method. The carrying value of this investment at May 29, 2021 and May 30, 2020 was $ 768 thousand and $ 2.0 million, respectively. The following relates to the Company’s transactions with these unconsolidated affiliates (in thousands): For the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 June 1, 2019 Sales to unconsolidated entities $ 56,765 $ 54,559 $ 58,093 Purchases from unconsolidated entities 76,059 71,475 81,685 Distributions from unconsolidated entities 6,663 7,114 7,904 May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Accounts receivable from unconsolidated entities 2,404 $ 4,935 Accounts payable to unconsolidated entities 4,161 5,706

Retired officers and spouses are eligible for lifetime benefits under the plan. Officers and their spouses, who retired prior to May 1, 2012, must participate in Medicare Plans A and B. Officers, and their spouses, who retire on or after May 1, 2012 must participate in Medicare Plans A, B, and D. The plan is accounted for in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”), whereby an employer recognizes the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability, and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year the change occurs through comprehensive income. Additionally, this expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employees’ approximate period of employment.

No amounts were borrowed under the facility as of May 29, 2021 or during fiscal 2021. The Company had $ 4.1 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility at May 29, 2021. The interest rate is based, at the Company’s election, on either the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin or the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The “Eurodollar Rate” means the reserve adjusted rate at which Eurodollar deposits in the London interbank market for an interest period of one, two, three, six or twelve months (as selected by the Company) are quoted. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 % per annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the administrative agent, and (c) the Eurodollar Rate for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 % per annum, subject to certain interest rate floors. The “Applicable Margin” means 0 % to 0.75 % per annum for Base Rate Loans and 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, in each case depending upon the average outstanding balance at the quarterly pricing date. The Company will pay a commitment fee of 0.2 % on the unused portion of the facility.

No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time. The Company’s Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Restated Charter”) identifies family members of Mr. Adams (“Immediate Family Members”) and arrangements and entities that are permitted to receive and hold shares of Class A Common Stock, with ten votes per share, without such shares converting into shares of Common Stock, with one vote per share (“Permitted Transferees”). The Permitted Transferees include arrangements and entities such as revocable trusts and limited liability companies that could hold Class A Common Stock for the benefit of Immediate Family Members. Each Permitted Transferee must have a relationship, specifically defined in the Restated Charter, with another Permitted Transferee or an Immediate Family Member. A share of Class A Common Stock transferred to a person other than a Permitted Transferee would automatically convert into Common Stock with one vote per share. Additionally, the Restated Charter includes a sunset provision pursuant to which all of the outstanding Class A Common Stock will automatically convert to Common Stock if: (a) less than 4,300,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees, or (b) if less than 4,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and Common Stock, in the aggregate, are beneficially owned by Immediate Family Members and/or Permitted Transferees. Note 13 - Net Income per Common Share Basic net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on the weighted average Common Stock and Class A Common Stock outstanding. Diluted net income per share attributable to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is based on weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.

Table of Contents 51 Note 12 - Equity The Company has two classes of capital stock: Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or the Company's certificate of incorporation, holders of shares of the Company’s capital stock vote as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, with each share of Common Stock entitled to one vote and each share of Class A Common Stock entitled to ten votes. Holders of capital stock have the right of cumulative voting in the election of directors. The Common Stock and Class A Common Stock have equal liquidation rights and the same dividend rights. In the case of any dividend payable in stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive the same percentage dividend (payable only in shares of Common Stock) as the holders of Class A Common Stock receive (payable only in shares of Class A Common Stock). Upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably with the holders of Class A Common Stock in all assets available for distribution after payment in full of creditors. The holders of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive or subscription rights. No class of capital stock may be combined or subdivided unless the other classes of capital stock are combined or subdivided in the same proportion. No dividend may be declared and paid on Class A Common Stock unless the dividend is payable only to the holders of Class A Common Stock and a dividend is declared and paid to Common Stock concurrently. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of its holder, into one share of Common Stock at any time.

Pricing for the most part is determined when the Company and the customer agree upon the specific order, which establishes the contract for that order. Revenues are recognized in an amount that reflects the net consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods. Our shell eggs are sold at prices related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or formulas related to our costs of production. The Company’s sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation. We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation with the customer which typically occurs within days of the Company and the customer agreeing upon the order. Costs to deliver product to customers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $ 52.7 million, $ 52.2 million, and $ 53.6 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Returns and Refunds Some of our contracts include a guaranteed sale clause, pursuant to which we credit the customer’s account for product that the customer is unable to sell before expiration. The Company records an allowance of returns and refunds by using historical return data and comparing to current period sales and accounts receivable. The allowance is recorded as a reduction in sales with a corresponding reduction in trade accounts receivable. Sales Incentives Provided to Customers The Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers (e.g., percentage discounts off current purchases), inducement offers (e.g., offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase), and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted by customers, are treated as a reduction to sales price based on estimated future redemption rates. Redemption rates are estimated using the Company’s historical experience for similar inducement offers. Current discount and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in ‘‘Net sales.’’ Disaggregation of Revenue The following table provides revenue disaggregated by product category (in thousands): 13 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 May 29, 2021 May 30, 2020 Conventional shell egg sales $ 205,987 $ 311,380 $ 766,284 $ 830,278 Specialty shell egg sales 131,243 133,347 539,780 485,465 Egg products 10,997 7,204 36,733 31,414 Other 1,571 1,402 6,190 4,452 $ 349,798 $ 453,333 $ 1,348,987 $ 1,351,609 Contract Costs The Company can incur costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. If the amortization period of these costs is less than one year, they are expensed as incurred. When the amortization period is greater than one year, a contract asset is recognized and is amortized over the contract life as a reduction in net sales. As of May 29, 2021 the balance for contract assets is immaterial. Contract Balances The Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from delivery. There are rarely contract assets or liabilities related to performance under the contract.

The CARES Act contains several income tax provisions, as well as other measures, that are intended to assist businesses impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant provision of the CARES Act that materially affects our accounting for income taxes includes a five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in tax years 2018 through 2020, our fiscal years 2019 through 2021. Our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021 were materially affected by the changes enacted by the CARES Act. As a result of the applicable accounting guidance and the provisions enacted by the CARES Act, our income tax provision for fiscal 2021 reflects the carryback of taxable net operating losses generated during periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 21% to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate was 35%. Due to the difference in statutory rates, we recorded a $ 16.0 million discrete income tax benefit related to the carryback provisions during the fiscal year ended May 29, 2021. Because the net operating losses were carried back to years in which we initially reduced our taxable income using the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, we recorded a partially offsetting $ 3.6 million discrete income tax expense during fiscal 2021 to account for the reduced taxable income. Federal and state income taxes of $ 995 thousand, $ 32 thousand, and $ 37.4 million were paid in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Federal and state income taxes of $ 2.6 million, $ 8.4 million, and $ 418 thousand were refunded in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company measures the tax benefits recognized based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Table of Contents 56 As of May 29, 2021, we are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the fiscal years 2013 through 2015. Although we are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions within the U.S., we were not under audit by any state and local tax authorities. As of May 29, 2021, the IRS has proposed adjustments related to the Company’s research and development credits claimed during the years under audit. Management is continuing to evaluate those proposed adjustments and does not anticipate the adjustments would result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that an additional decrease of up to $ 1.4 million in previously recognized tax benefits related to research and development credits may be necessary within the coming year. Tax periods for all years beginning with fiscal year 2013 remain open to examination by federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies Financial Instruments The Company maintained standby letters of credit ("LOC") totaling $ 4.1 million at May 29, 2021, which were issued under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding LOCs are for the benefit of certain insurance companies. None of the LOCs are recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC On April 23, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary Wharton County Foods, LLC (“WCF”) were named as defendants in State of Texas v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. d/b/a Wharton; and Wharton County Foods, LLC, Cause No. 2020-25427, in the District Court of Harris County, Texas. The State of Texas (the “State”) asserted claims based on the Company’s and WCF’s alleged violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices—Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code §§ 17.41-17.63 (“DTPA”). The State claimed that the Company and WCF offered shell eggs at excessive or exorbitant prices during the COVID-19 state of emergency and made misleading statements about shell egg prices. The State sought temporary and permanent injunctions against the Company and WCF to prevent further alleged violations of the DTPA, along with over $ 100,000 in damages. On August 13, 2020, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the State’s original petition with prejudice. On September 11, 2020, the State filed a notice of appeal, which was assigned to the Texas Court of Appeals for the First District. The State filed its opening brief on December 7, 2020. The Company and WCF filed their response on February 8, 2021. The Texas Court of Appeals has not ruled on these submissions. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al. On April 30, 2020, the Company was named as one of several defendants in Bell et al. v. Cal-Maine Foods et al., Case No. 1:20- cv-461, in the Western District of Texas, Austin Division. The defendants include numerous grocery stores, retailers, producers, and farms. Plaintiffs assert that defendants violated the DTPA by allegedly demanding exorbitant or excessive prices for eggs during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs request certification of a class of all consumers who purchased eggs in Texas sold, distributed, produced, or handled by any of the defendants during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from selling eggs at a price more than 10% greater than the price of eggs prior to the declaration of the state of emergency and damages in the amount of $ 10,000 per violation, or $ 250,000 for each violation impacting anyone over 65 years old. On December 1, 2020, the Company and certain other defendants filed their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ first amended class action complaint. The court has not ruled on this motion to dismiss. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al. As previously reported, on September 25, 2008, the Company was named as one of several defendants in numerous antitrust cases involving the United States shell egg industry. The Company settled all of these cases, except for the claims of certain plaintiffs who sought substantial damages allegedly arising from the purchase of egg products (as opposed to shell eggs). These remaining plaintiffs are Kraft Food Global, Inc., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the “Egg Products Plaintiffs”) and The Kellogg Company. On September 13, 2019, the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs was remanded from a multi-district litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 2002, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. et al. v. United Egg Producers, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:11-cv-8808, for trial. The Egg Products Plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15. U.S.C. § 1, by agreeing to limit the production of eggs and thereby illegally to raise the prices that plaintiffs paid for processed egg products. In particular, the Egg Products Plaintiffs are attacking certain features of the United Egg Producers animal-welfare guidelines and program used by the Company and many other egg producers. The

The Table of Contents 57 Egg Products Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Company and other defendants from engaging in antitrust violations and seek treble money damages. The parties filed a joint status report on May 18, 2020, but no schedule has yet been entered by the court. It appears that the case will not be tried until later in 2021 or 2022. In addition, on October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with The Kellogg Company dismissing all claims against the Company for an amount that did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. On November 11, 2019, a stipulation for dismissal was filed with the court, but the court has not yet entered a judgment on the filing. The Company intends to continue to defend the remaining case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs as vigorously as possible based on defenses which the Company believes are meritorious and provable. Adjustments, if any, which might result from the resolution of this remaining matter with the Egg Products Plaintiffs have not been reflected in the financial statements. While management believes that there is still a reasonable possibility of a material adverse outcome from the case with the Egg Products Plaintiffs, at the present time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of monetary exposure, if any, to the Company due to a range of factors, including the following, among others: the matter is in the early stages of preparing for trial following remand; any trial will be before a different judge and jury in a different court than prior related cases; there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and there are requests for damages other than compensatory damages (i.e., injunction and treble money damages). State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution Litigation On June 18, 2005, the State of Oklahoma filed suit, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, against Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Tyson Foods, Inc. and affiliates, Cobb-Vantress, Inc., Cargill, Inc. and its affiliate, George’s, Inc. and its affiliate, Peterson Farms, Inc. and Simmons Foods, Inc. The State of Oklahoma claims that through the disposal of chicken litter the defendants have polluted the Illinois River Watershed. This watershed provides water to eastern Oklahoma. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages, but the claim for monetary damages has been dismissed by the court. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. discontinued operations in the watershed. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. will be materially affected by the request for injunctive relief unless the court orders substantial affirmative remediation. Since the litigation began, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. purchased 100 % of the membership interests of Benton County Foods, LLC, which is an ongoing commercial shell egg operation within the Illinois River Watershed. Benton County Foods, LLC is not a defendant in the litigation. The trial in the case began in September 2009 and concluded in February 2010. The case was tried without a jury, and the court has not yet issued its ruling. Management believes the risk of material loss related to this matter to be remote. Other Matters In addition to the above, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined with certainty, management, upon the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that the final outcome should not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. Note 19 - Related Party Transaction On August 24, 2020, Mrs. Jean Reed Adams, the wife of the Company’s late founder Fred R. Adams, Jr., and the Fred R. Adams, Jr. Daughters’ Trust, dated July 20, 2018 (the “Daughters’ Trust”), of which the daughters of Mr. Adams are beneficiaries (together, the “Selling Stockholders”), completed a registered secondary public offering of 6,900,000 shares of Common Stock held by them, pursuant to a previously disclosed Agreement Regarding Common Stock (the “Agreement”) filed as an exhibit to this report. Mrs. Adams and the Daughters’ Trust advised the Company that they were conducting the offering in order to pay estate taxes related to the settlement of Mr. Adam’s estate and to obtain liquidity. The public offering was made pursuant to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-227742), including the Prospectus contained therein dated October 9, 2018, and a related Prospectus Supplement dated August 19, 2020, each of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The public offering involved only the sale of shares of Common Stock that were already outstanding, and thus the Company did not issue any new shares or raise any additional capital in the offering. The expenses of the offering (not including the underwriting discount and legal fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Selling Stockholders, which were paid by the Selling Stockholders) paid by the Company were $ 1.1 million. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Selling Stockholders reimbursed the Company $ 551 thousand.

(b) Attestation Report of the Registrant’s Public Accounting Firm Table of Contents 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2021, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as May 29, 2021, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company and our report dated July 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCOAB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Table of Contents 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries Ridgeland, Mississippi Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of May 29, 2021, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as May 29, 2021, based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company and our report dated July 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the entity’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCOAB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Frost, PLLC Little Rock, Arkansas July 19, 2021 Table of Contents 61 (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In connection with its evaluation of the effectiveness, as of May 29, 2021, of our internal control over financial reporting, management determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended May 29, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
