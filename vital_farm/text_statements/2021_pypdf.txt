Contingencies
 
We recognize the costs of legal defense for the legal proceedings to which we are a party during the periods in which the costs are incurred. After
considerable analysis of the facts and circumstances of each case, we determine the amount of reserves required, if any.
At this time, we have not accrued any reserves for any legal proceedings. Future reserves may be required if losses are deemed reasonably estimable and
probable due to changes in our assumptions, the effectiveness of legal strategies, or other factors beyond our control. Future results of operations may be
materially affected by the creation of reserves or by accruals of losses to reflect any adverse determinations in these legal proceedings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See the sections titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” and    “—Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted” in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of
recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may take advantage of the
extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to
use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public
companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due
to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in raw materials, ingredients, inflation
and interest rates.
Raw Materials Pricing Risk
The packaging materials used for our products include cardboard, glass, corrugated fiberboard, kraft paper, flexible plastic, flexible film and paperboard.
These raw materials are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these
raw materials as of December 26, 2021 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the year ended December 26, 2021 of
approximately $2.1 million. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw materials cost increases by negotiating pricing agreements. We strive to offset the impact of
raw materials cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.

Ingredient Risk
We source our eggs and cream for our products from our network of family farms. The price we pay to purchase shell eggs from farmers fluctuates
based on pallet weight, and under our buy-sell contracts, which account for 98% of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December 26, 2021,
the price we pay is also indexed quarterly in arrears for changes in feed cost, which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a
quarterly basis. Under the remainder of our contracts, we are directly responsible for purchasing feed. Either type of contract subjects us to risk of price
fluctuations in feed ingredients, primarily consisting of corn and soy. The price we pay for cream is subject to butter commodity fluctuations. We do not attempt
to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of these ingredients by using future, forward, option or other derivative instruments. A hypothetical 10% increase or
decrease in the weighted-average cost of these ingredients across our product lines as of December 26, 2021 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to
cost of sales for the year ended December 26, 2021 of approximately $4.9 million. We strive to offset the impact of ingredient cost increases with a combination
of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.
Inflation Risk
If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our
inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility. See the
section titled “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facility” above for additional details related to our Credit Facility. Based on the average interest rate
on the instruments under the Credit Facility during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2021, and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not
believe that a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal year
ended December 26, 2021.
Our interest-earning instruments also carry a degree of interest rate risk. As of December 26, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31.0 million
and investments in available for sale securities of $68.6 million.
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate
risk exposure.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our net revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. We purchase
certain equipment from foreign countries, and the cost related to this equipment is denominated in the currency of the applicable country. Additionally, to the
extent our sourcing strategy changes or we commence generating revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar, our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to
foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value
of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would not have had a material effect on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2021.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Vital Farms, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vital Farms, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 26, 2021 and December
27, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, redeemable convertible preferred stock, redeemable noncontrolling interest
and stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 26, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.

VITAL FARMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Vital Farms, Inc. (“Vital Farms” or “the Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on June 6, 2013 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. Vital Farms
packages, markets and distributes shell eggs, butter and other products. These products are sold under the trade names Vital Farms, Alfresco Farms, Lucky
Ladies and RedHill Farms, primarily to retail and foodservice channels in the United States.
Vital Farms of Missouri, LLC, Backyard Eggs, LLC, Barn Door Farms, LLC, Sagebrush Foodservice, LLC and Vital Farms, LLC re all wholly owned
subsidiaries of Vital Farms. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the audited consolidated financial statements.
Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December and contains either 52 or 53 weeks. Therefore, the financial results of
certain 53-week years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week years. The years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and
December 29, 2019 all contain operating results for 52 weeks.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented business continuity plans designed to
address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business. The Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19
pandemic will have a material impact on the timelines for the Company’s product development and expansion efforts. However, the extent to which the
COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s business, product development and expansion efforts, corporate development objectives and the value of and
market for the Company’s common stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time,
such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States, and the
effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease, including the roll-out of vaccines. The global economic slowdown, the overall disruption
of global supply chains and distribution systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 
Forward Stock Split: In July 2020, the board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a 2.46-for-1 forward stock split of the
Company’s outstanding common stock and preferred stock, which was effected on July 22, 2020. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares as a result of the
forward stock split received a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares. All common stock, preferred stock, and per share information has been
retroactively adjusted to give effect to this forward stock split for all periods presented. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock options and other
equity instruments were proportionately increased and the respective per share value and exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately decreased in
accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. There were no changes in the par values of the Company’s common stock and preferred
stock as a result of the forward stock split.
 
Initial Public Offering: In August 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,699,573 shares of common stock at an offering
price of $22.00 per share.  The Company offered 5,040,323 shares of common stock and the selling stockholders offered an additional 5,659,250 shares of
common stock, including the underwriter’s option to purchase up to an additional 1,395,596 shares of common stock from the selling stockholders. The
Company received gross proceeds of approximately $110,887 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering related transaction costs; the
Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.  Upon the closing of the IPO in August 2020, all of the then-
outstanding shares of preferred stock automatically converted into 8,192,876 shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Subsequent to the closing of the
IPO, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding. The consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2021, including share and per share
amounts, include the effects of the IPO.
Secondary Public Offering: In November 2020, the Company completed a secondary public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock from selling
stockholders in which no proceeds from the sale of shares were received by the Company and the Company incurred $0.5 million of expenses.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition, determination of useful lives for property and
equipment, trade spend accruals, goodwill, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, valuation of common stock prior to IPO, stock option
valuations, accrual liabilities and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance related to the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic that would require the Company to update its estimates, assumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of its assets or liabilities.
These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as
they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
Deferred Offering Costs: The Company capitalized certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly related to the Company’s in-
process equity financings until such financings were completed.  Upon closing the IPO in August 2020, all deferred offering costs were reclassified from
prepaid and other current assets and recorded against the IPO proceeds reducing additional paid-in capital.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains deposits with large financial institutions that the
Company believes are of high credit quality. At times the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents balances.
As of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, the Company had customers that individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s accounts
receivable, net. During fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company also had customers that individually exceeded 10% or more of the Company’s net
revenue. Significant customer information is presented below as follows:
 
  
Net Revenue YearEndedDecember 26,2021   
Net RevenueYear EndedDecember 27,2020   
Net RevenueYear EndedDecember 29,2019   
AccountsReceivable, NetAs OfDecember 26,2021   
AccountsReceivable, NetAs OfDecember 27,2020  
Customer A  18%   15%   35%   19%   *  
Customer B  14%   18%   *   *   20%  
Customer C  10%   12%   11%   *   *  
Customer D  12%   13%   14%   13%   15%
 
 
*Revenue and/or accounts receivable was less than 10%.
 
The increase in net revenue for Customer A for fiscal 2021 is due a net shift in the Company’s distribution channels from Customer B to Customer A
during the year ended December 26, 2021. Net revenue for Customers C and D increased from 2020 to 2021; however, growth from other existing customers
and new customers resulted in net revenue from Customers C and D comprising a lower percentage of total net revenue.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United States. As of December 26, 2021, cash and cash
equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with balances denominated in U.S. dollars and investments in money market funds.
 
Investment Securities: The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity
Securities. The Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company's
ability to sell within the next 12 months as available-for-sale. We have classified these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for
current operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.
 
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in interest income.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and declines in value due to
credit-related factors are recorded in other income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.

Variable Interest Entity: The Company consolidates all entities where a controlling financial interest exists. The Company has considered its
relationships with a certain entity to determine whether the Company has a variable interest in that entity, and if so, whether the Company is the primary
beneficiary of the relationship. GAAP requires variable interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated if an entity’s interest in the VIE is a controlling financial
interest. Under the variable model, a controlling financial interest is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE
that most significantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the
right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Management performs ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE will
cause the consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of a VIE may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status
are applied prospectively in accordance with GAAP.
Segment Information: The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment. The Company’s chief executive
officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of evaluating financial performance and
allocating resources. All of the Company’s long-lived assets and customers are located in the United States.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined below:
 
 •  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
 
•  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
 
 •  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of
the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.
 
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate
their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings. Losses are charged against the
allowance when management believes the receivable is no longer collectible. These losses have been immaterial to date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are
credited to the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on the credit risk of specific
customers, past collection history, and management’s evaluation of accounts receivable. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are
susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. As of December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, the Company recorded an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $269 and $196 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Inventory includes eggs
and egg related products, butter and butter related products, packaging, feed, laying hens, pullets, merchandise and equipment parts. A reduction in the carrying
value of an inventory item from cost to net realizable value is recorded in cost of goods sold with the offset to inventory. Any inventory that does not meet the
quality control standards of the Company is separated and written down to its net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The general range of useful lives of other property, plant and
equipment is as follows:
    
   Estimated Useful Life
Land   N/A
Building and improvements   39 years
Vehicles   5 years
Machinery and equipment   2 to 7 years
Furniture and fixtures   5 years
Leasehold improvements   Lesser of lease term or 5 years
70

--- PAGE 72 ---
 
 
When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, with
any resulting gain or loss recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business
combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s goodwill impairment test is performed at the enterprise level given the single
reporting unit.
 
The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances existed that would lead the Company to conclude that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of the reporting unit is below the carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill assessment is required. In the quantitative evaluation, the fair value of the
reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be
recoverable and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which
the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value and a charge is reported as impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statements of operations. To
date, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges associated with its goodwill.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual
disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by
which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating
results, trends and prospects and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company did not recognize an impairment
loss during the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019.
Contingent Consideration: In connection with the Company’s acquisition of certain assets of Heartland Eggs, LLC in 2014, the Company was
required to make royalty payments to prior owners of certain assets of Heartland Eggs. The royalty payments are contingent on the Company’s future purchase
of eggs from supplier contracts that were acquired in the certain assets of Heartland Eggs acquisition. The royalty payments are deemed to be contingent
because the future egg purchases are not guaranteed, and the timing and amount of any such purchases are unknown. The fair value of the contingent
consideration was determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs included projected financial information, market
volatility, risk-adjusted discount rates and timing of contractual payments. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent
consideration liability is remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s
consolidated statements of operations.
Noncontrolling Interest: The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to VIEs, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as equity
in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity’s equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is
included in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the parent entity’s ownership interest in a subsidiary
that do not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, when a subsidiary
is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss. Affiliate equity interests where the Company has certain rights to demand
settlement are presented at their current redemption values, as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Because these transactions
take place between entities under common control, any gains or losses attributable to these transactions are required to be included within additional paid-in-
capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences, the
Company considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded, if necessary, to reduce
net deferred tax assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.
The Company follows the provisions of the authoritative guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes. These provisions provide a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial statements of
uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under these provisions, a company can recognize the benefit of an
income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the
technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the
sustainability of the position and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of
each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed. Additionally, the Company must accrue interest and related penalties, if
applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.
71

--- PAGE 73 ---
 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 26,
2021 and December 27, 2020 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. Common Stockholders: The Company applies the two-class method to compute
basic and diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders when shares meet the definition of participating securities.
The two-class method determines net income per share for each class of the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock according to dividends declared or
accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be
allocated between the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income for the period
had been distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the Preferred Stock does not have a contractual
obligation to share in the Company’s losses.
Basic net income per share attributable to the Company’s stockholders is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during the period without consideration of potentially dilutive common stock. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares of the Company’s common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance
of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company unless inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company
reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders is the same as basic net loss, because potentially
dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of products to its customers, which include natural channel retailers,
mainstream channel retailers and foodservice partners. The Company sells its products to customers on a purchase-order basis.
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and the related performance obligation is satisfied, which typically
occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer, for an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering
the product. We offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and allow deductions from our customers, which may include credits or discounts
to customers in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer’s site. The cost associated with promotions and
chargebacks is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue and is recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the
actual cash expenditure. The recognition of this cost therefore requires management judgement regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be
redeemed. Differences between estimated cost and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.
Treasury Stock: The Company records treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury
stock. The Company’s accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from the Company’s common stock and to
reflect any excess of cost over par value as a reduction to additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares).
Shipping and Distribution: The Company’s shipping and distribution costs include costs incurred with third-party carriers to transport products to
customers and salaries and overhead costs related to activities to prepare the Company’s products for shipment. Shipping and distribution costs were $24,979,
$14,904, and $10,001 during the years ended December 26,2021, December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively. Freight-in costs are included within
Cost of Goods Sold and were $7,623, $5,126, and $3,012 during the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of
the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective
award. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on
certain subjective assumptions, including the fair market value of the Company’s common stock, expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the
option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company’s expected dividend yield. The Company
classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are
classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
72

Advertising and Promotion Expenses: Advertising and promotion expenses consist primarily of production costs and the costs to communicate the
advertisements to promote and market the Company’s products.  Production costs such as idea development, artwork, audio and video crews and other up-front
development costs are expensed the first time the associated advertising campaign is launched or aired.  The costs to communicate the advertisements such as
airtime and distribution costs are expensed as incurred.  During the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019, the
Company incurred advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $11,469, $9,815, and $10,320, respectively.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status: The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
(“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as those
standards apply to private companies. The Company elected to use the extended transition period for complying with the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and, as a result of this election, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective
dates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of
the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to
contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another
reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company
adopted ASU 2020-04 on March 12, 2020 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-
02”) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20, ASU 2019-01,
ASU 2019-10, ASU 2020-02, and ASU 2020-05 (collectively, “Topic 842”). The guidance in Topic 842 supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases.
Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve
months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of
operations. An entity may adopt the guidance either (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative-
effect adjustment recognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption
through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company expects to adopt Topic 842 retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption, December 27,
2021, through a cumulative-effect adjustment, and will not apply the new standard to comparative periods presented. The new standard provides a number of
practical expedients. Upon adoption, the Company expects to elect all of the practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
its pending adoption of Topic 842 on its consolidated financial statements. It is anticipated that the primary impact of the adoption of Topic 842 will be the
recording of a right-of-use asset and related lease liability of approximately $4.0 million on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU
2019-11, ASU 2020-02, and ASU 2020-03 (collectively, “Topic 326”), to introduce a new impairment model for recognizing credit losses on financial
instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. Topic 326 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net
amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining
the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. For non-public companies, Topic 326 is effective for years beginning
after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those years. The Company expects to adopt Topic 326 on December 26, 2022. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 326 on its consolidated financial statements.
73

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”),
which intends to simplify the guidance by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying or amending existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 is
effective for years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company expects to adopt
ASU 2019-12 on December 26, 2022. Although the Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2019-12, the Company does not expect
it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

10. Long-Term Debt
In October 2017, the Company entered into a credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (the “Credit Facility”) that provided for an
initial term loan of $4,700 (the “Term Loan”) and a revolving line of credit of up to $10,000 (the “Revolving Line of Credit”). The Credit Facility also
originally provided for a $1,500 equipment loan (the “Equipment Loan”) for the purpose of funding permitted capital expenditures, subject to certain
restrictions.  
Subsequently, the terms of the Credit Facility were modified at various times throughout fiscal 2018-2021 which (i) amended various definitions, (ii)
waived a technical default in May 2020 which was triggered by exceeding the capital expenditure limit, and (iii) increased borrowing capacity and (iv)
extended the maturity date. The Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility in April 2021 eliminated the Term Loan and Equipment Loan. The Revolving Line of
Credit matures in April 2024.         
The maximum borrowing capacity under the Revolving Line of Credit is $20,000.  Interest on borrowings under the Revolving Line of Credit, as well as
loan advances thereunder, accrues at a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.00% or (ii) 1.00% plus the alternate
base rate. As of December 26, 2021, there were no outstanding amounts under the Revolving Line of Credit.   
77

--- PAGE 79 ---
 
The Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company’s assets (other than real property and certain other property excluded pursuant to the terms of the
Credit Facility) and requires the Company to comply with three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net
worth requirement. The Credit Facility also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and the
sale of properties and liens. As a result of the limitations contained in the Credit Facility, certain of the net assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
as of December 26, 2021 are restricted in use. Vital Farms’ wholly owned subsidiaries are non-operating and do not hold any assets or liabilities; therefore,
these subsidiaries have no restricted net assets within the meaning of Rule 4-08(e)(3) or Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X. The Credit Facility also contains other
customary covenants, representations and events of default. As of December 26, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit
Facility.
Debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility are reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheets and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Credit Facility using the effective interest method. During the years ended
December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019, the Company recognized interest expense of $52, $488, and $349 respectively, which
includes amortization of debt issuance costs of $0, $68, and $9, respectively.
As of December 26, 2021, future principal payments for capital lease payments are $327 for the fiscal year ending December 25, 2022, due to the August
2022 expiration of the capital lease.
 
Amounts outstanding under the Company’s Revolving Line of Credit as of December 27, 2020 have been presented as current obligations under current
portion of long-term debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability and intent to repay the amounts within the next twelve
months.
Paycheck Protection Program Loan: In April 2020, the Company received loan proceeds of approximately $2,593 under the Paycheck Protection
Program (“PPP”) (the “PPP Loan”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), provides for loans
to qualified businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses for the qualifying business. The Company elected to not use any of
the PPP Loan proceeds of $2,593 and repaid the entire balance of the PPP Loan in April 2020.
11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
Upon the closing of the IPO in August 2020, all of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock automatically converted into 8,192,876 shares of
common stock on a one-for-one basis. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, there were no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.
As of December 26, 2021, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the Company to issue 10,000,000 shares, par value
$0.0001 per share, of preferred stock, in one or more series and with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the
Company’s board of directors (collectively, the “Preferred Stock”). As of December 26, 2021, there were no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding.    
12. Common Stock and Common Stock Warrant
Common Stock: As of December 26, 2021, Vital Farms’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the Company to issue 310,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of which 40,493,969 shares were issued and outstanding.
In March 2019 and April 2019, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 2,815,012 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.3286 per share,
for proceeds of $14,097, net of issuance costs of $903.
In March 2019 and April 2019, the Company executed a tender offer to repurchase 2,852,770 shares of its common stock and the vested equity of certain
directors, employees and officers for a net purchase price of $5.0087 per shares for net proceeds of $14,289.  
The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the Company’s common stock are subject to and qualified by the rights, powers and
preferences of the holders of Preferred Stock, if any. Each share of the Company’s common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the
Company’s stockholders. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared by the Company’s board of directors, if
any, subject to the preferential dividend rights of Preferred Stock, if any. No cash dividends had been declared or paid during the periods presented.

Common Stock Warrant: In June 2015, the Company issued a warrant to the guarantor of a line of credit agreement that was entered into in
2015.  During 2017 the line of credit matured and was repaid in full. The guarantor was also the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The warrant provided for
the purchase of a total of 196,800 shares of Vital Farms common stock at an exercise price of $1.43 per share. The warrant was scheduled to expire on the
earlier of June 12, 2020 or the completion of the IPO. At the time of issuance, the Company classified the warrant as equity in its consolidated balance sheets.
On June 9, 2020, the guarantor exercised the warrant to purchase 196,800 shares of Vital Farms’ common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately
$282.

13. Stock-Based Compensation
As of December 26, 2021, 9,993,187 shares were available for future grants of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Vital Farms, Inc. 2020
Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Incentive Plan”) and the 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan (“2020 ESPP”).
 
2020 Equity Incentive Plan: In July 2020, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Vital Farms, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Incentive
Plan”), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders and became effective on July 30, 2020. Initially, the maximum number of shares of
the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2020 Incentive Plan was 8,595,871 shares. The 2020 Incentive Plan provides that the number of
shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 Incentive Plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending
on (and including) January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to 4% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December
31 or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company’s board of directors. On January 1, 2022, 1,619,758 shares of common stock were added to
the available reserve pursuant to this provision.
 
We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, which uses the expected option
term, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected option term assumption reflects the period for which we believe the option will remain
outstanding. We elected to use the simplified method to determine the expected option term, for all periods presented, which is the average of the option’s
vesting and contractual term. Our computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of selected comparable publicly traded companies over
a period equal to the expected term of the option. The risk-free interest rate reflects the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a similar instrument with the same
expected term in effect at the time of the grant.
 
The following assumptions were utilized to calculate the fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal periods indicated:
 
             
  December 26,2021   December 27,2020   December 29,2019  
Expected term (in years)  6.0 - 6.5   5.2 - 6.5   5.4  - 6.5  
Expected stock price volatility  28.5% - 29.4%   29.1% - 42.9%   39.5% - 47.0%  
Risk-free interest rate  0.57% - 1.36%   0.34% - 0.49%   1.4% - 2.38%  
Expected dividend yield  0%   0%   0%  
Weighted average fair value at grant date  $ 7.31   $ 6.83   $ 2.31

to 900,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to certain eligible employees or, as designated by the board of directors, employees of a related company.
The 2020 ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 ESPP will automatically increase each January 1,
beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the outstanding number of shares of
common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 and (ii) 900,000, or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Vital Farms board of
directors. On January 1, 2022, 404,939 shares of common stock were added to the available reserve pursuant to this provision. The Company’s board of
directors may periodically grant or provide for the grant to eligible employees the ability to purchase common stock under the 2020 ESPP during a specific
offering period. In November 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an initial offering of common stock under the 2020 ESPP
to eligible employees, which commenced March 1, 2022.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December
26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 were comprised of the following:
  December 26,2021   December 27,2020  
Deferred tax assets:         
    Accrued expenses  $ 1,383  $ 1,144 
    Allowances and other reserves   212   80 
    Inventory   387   368 
    Net operating loss carryforwards   2,220   27 
    Charitable contributions   774   322 
    Stock-based compensation   460   205 
    Other   90   11 
           Total deferred tax assets   5,526   2,157 
Less: Valuation allowance   (774)   - 
           Net deferred tax assets  $ 4,752  $ 2,157 
Deferred tax liabilities:         
    Prepaid expenses  $ 784  $ 906 
    Property and equipment   3,610   3,497 
    Intangibles   279   291 
          Total deferred tax liabilities   4,673   4,694 
          Net deferred tax assets or liabilities  $ 79  $ 2,537
 
 
A valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A full review of all positive and negative
evidence needs to be considered, including the Company’s current and past performance, the market environments in which the Company operates, the
utilization of past tax credits, the length of carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that might be implemented. Management
considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The net change in the total valuation
allowance for the year ended December 26, 2021 was an increase of approximately $774.
The activity in the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020 was as follows:
  December 26,2021   December 27,2020  
Valuation allowance as of beginning of year  $ -  $ 138 
    Increases recorded to income tax provision   774   — 
    Decreases recorded as benefit to income tax
        provision   -   (138)
Valuation allowance as of end of year  $ 774  $ -
 
 
As of December 26, 2021, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, which represent the aggregate tax effect of the differences between tax return
positions and the benefits recognized in the Company’s financial statements. At December 26, 2021, all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would
affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and we do not anticipate the balance of the unrecognized
tax benefits to change in the next twelve months.
The following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits:
  December 26,2021   December 27,2020  
Gross tax contingencies as of beginning of year  $ 219  $ 272 
    Increase in gross tax contingencies   -   219 
   Decrease in gross tax contingencies   -   (272)
Gross tax contingencies as of end of year  $ 219  $ 219
 
 
As of December 26, 2021, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $9.1 million which can be carried forward indefinitely.  The
Company also had state net operating loss carryforwards of $3.9 million which begin to expire in 2022.

The Company files a U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states.  Tax years 2018 through 2020 remain open to
examination by the tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject, with certain state taxing jurisdictions being open back to 2017.
15. Net Income Per Share
Basic and diluted net income per share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders were calculated as follows:
 
  Fiscal Year Ended  
  December 26,2021   December 27,2020   December 29,2019  
Numerator:             
Net income  $ 2,382  $ 8,884  $ 3,312 
Less: Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests   (47)  84   927 
Net income attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. stockholders’ — basic
   and diluted  $ 2,429  $ 8,800  $ 2,385 
Denominator:             
Weighted average common shares outstanding — basic   40,027,278   28,667,264   25,897,223 
Weighted average effect of potentially dilutive securities:             
Effect of potentially dilutive stock options   3,290,615   4,142,947   1,826,084 
Effect of potentially dilutive common stock warrants   —   82,993   154,832 
Effect of potentially dilutive restricted stock units   3,840   21,449   — 
Effect of potentially dilutive redeemable convertible preferred stock   —   —   8,192,876 
Weighted average common shares outstanding — diluted   43,321,733   32,914,653   36,071,015 
Net income per share attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. stockholders             
Basic  $ 0.06  $ 0.31  $ 0.09 
Diluted  $ 0.06  $ 0.27  $ 0.07
 
 
For the years ended December 26, 2021 and December 27, 2020, options to purchase 23,744 shares of common stock and 826,883 shares of common
stock, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders because including
them would have been antidilutive.
16. Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Leases: As of December 26, 2021, the Company was leasing approximately 9,100 square feet of office space and parking spaces in Austin,
Texas. The lease expires in April 2026. The Company has the option to extend the lease agreement for successive periods of up to five years. The monthly lease
payments, which include base rent charges of $19, are subject to periodic rent increases through April 2026.
As of December 27, 2020, the Company was leasing warehouse space in Webb City, Missouri for 5,000 rentable pallet spaces. The monthly lease
payments include base rent charges of $55. In October 2020, the lease was amended to terminate the agreement effective December 31, 2020.
As of December 26, 2021, the Company was leasing approximately 92,000 square feet of warehouse space in Springfield, Missouri for 10,000 rentable
pallet spaces under an operating lease expiring in September 2023. The monthly lease payments, which include base rent charges of $79, are subject to periodic
rent increases through September 2023.  
The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the respective lease period and has recorded deferred rent for rent expense incurred but
not yet paid. During the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019, the Company recognized rent expense, including
associated common area maintenance charges, of $583, $444, and $358, respectively.
83

--- PAGE 85 ---
 
As of December 26, 2021, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows:
 
2022  $ 1,476 
2023   1,254 
2024   471 
2025   338 
Thereafter   115 
Total  $ 3,654
 
 
Supplier Contracts: The Company purchases its egg inventories under supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in these
arrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. Accordingly, there are no estimable future purchase commitments
associated with these supplier contracts. In addition, substantially all the Company’s supply contracts with farms contain components that meet the definition of
embedded leases within the scope of Topic 840, Leases. These arrangements convey to the Company the right to control implicitly identified property, plant and
equipment as it takes substantially all the utility generated by these assets over the term of the arrangements at a variable price. As total purchase commitments
contained in these arrangements are variable, the amounts attributable to the lease components are contingent rentals; there are no minimum lease payments
associated with these supply contracts. As the classification and timing of recognition of costs attributable to the eggs and embedded cost of the lease rentals are
identical, the Company does not allocate the total purchase cost of eggs between the cost of the eggs and the embedded cost of the lease rentals or distinguish
between them in its accounting records. The Company records the total purchase costs of eggs, which includes costs associated with the eggs and the
corresponding costs of embedded lease rentals from the same arrangement, into inventory. These costs are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated
eggs are sold to customers. During the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, and December 29, 2019, the Company recognized total costs
associated with its supply contracts with farms of $108,707, $84,537, and $54,380, respectively.
Indemnification Agreements: In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors,
lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from
intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its
board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by
reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. As of December 26, 2021, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such
indemnifications.
Litigation: The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies which are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to its business,
including those related to regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee-related matters and taxes, among others. When the Company becomes aware of
a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. The liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs incurred to date and future legal costs
to the point in the legal matter where the Company believes a conclusion to the matter will be reached. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss
cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible.
In January 2019, Ovabrite Inc. (“Ovabrite”) settled claims made pursuant to a lawsuit in which Ovabrite was the defendant and a countersuit in which
Ovabrite was the plaintiff and recorded a related gain of $1,200, which is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.
17. Related Party Transactions
Guarantor Warrant: The Company’s executive chairman and former Chief Executive Officer (the “Guarantor”) guaranteed the Company’s obligations
under a line of credit agreement that was entered into in 2015 and that matured and was repaid in full in 2017. The Company issued a warrant to purchase
196,800 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.43 to the Guarantor in exchange for his guaranty. See Note 12, “Common Stock and
Common Stock Warrant.” The warrant expired on the earlier of June 12, 2020 or the completion of the IPO. In June 2020, the Guarantor exercised the warrant
to purchase 196,800 shares of the Company’s common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $282.
Ovabrite: Ovabrite is a related party because its founders are stockholders of the Company, with the majority stockholder in Ovabrite also serving as the
Company’s executive chairman and member of the Company’s board of directors. Since Ovabrite’s incorporation in November 2016, the Company is deemed
to have had a variable interest in Ovabrite, and Ovabrite is deemed to have been a VIE, of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the
Company has consolidated the results of Ovabrite
84

--- PAGE 86 ---
 
since November 2016. All significant intercompany transactions between the Company and Ovabrite have been eliminated in consolidation. The Ovabrite entity
is immaterial as of the year ended December 26, 2021.
Notes Receivable from Related Parties: In February 2019, the Company issued promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $4,000 to its founder and a
former member of the board of directors that is currently a board observer, both of whom are also stockholders of the Company. The promissory notes bore
monthly interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% and were to mature on the earlier of August 7, 2022 or the date of closing of a liquidity transaction which is defined as a
merger, consolidation or sale of the Company’s assets or such time as the notes would be prohibited by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Promissory Note Maturity
Date”). All unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due on the Promissory Note Maturity Date. The borrower has the ability to prepay all or any
portion of the promissory note at any time without premium or penalty. In November 2019, $3,200 of the promissory notes were repaid.
In August 2020, the remaining $800 of the promissory notes were repaid.  During the years ended December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020, the Company
recorded interest income of $0 and $97, respectively, in connection with the promissory notes.  
Manna Tree Partners: In March 2019 and April 2019, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 2,815,012 shares of common stock at a purchase
price of $5.3286 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000, to entities associated with Manna Tree Partners. The co-founder and chief operating
officer of Manna Tree Partners is a member of the Company’s board of directors.
Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc.: The Company utilizes Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc. (“Sandpebble”) for project management
and related services associated with the construction and expansion of Egg Central Station. The owner and principal of Sandpebble is the father of an executive
of the Company. In connection with the services described above, the Company paid Sandpebble $1,037, $842, and $556 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
Amounts paid to Sandpebble are included in property, plant and equipment.
Whole Foods Market, Inc: A member of the Company’s board of directors was, until February 2022, an executive vice president and senior advisor at
Whole Foods. The Company serves the majority of its natural channel retail customers through food distributors, such as US Foods Inc. and United Natural
Foods, Inc., who purchase, store, sell and deliver products to Whole Foods Market, Inc. While the Company cannot precisely determine its specific revenue
attributable to Whole Foods, it is a significant customer.
18. 401(K) Savings Plan
The Company established a defined contribution savings plan in 2017 under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This
plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual
compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors. During the years ended
December 26, 2021, December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the Company made contributions totaling $651, $401, and $246 respectively, to the plan.
  
19. Subsequent Events
 
In January 2022, management of the Company determined that the Company would cease production of its breakfast bars and egg bites products
effective prior to the end of the first quarter ending March 27, 2022.  The Company expects to incur charges of approximately $2.1 million related to these
product discontinuations for inventory obsolescence and contract terminations during the quarter ending March 27, 2022.

Re: Your Promo on
 
Dear Kathryn,
 
It is my great pleasure to set forth the terms of your well-deserved promo on at Vital Farms, Inc. (the “Company”) eﬀec ve as of January 27,
2022 (the “Start Date”). Our success has been built on providing the highest quality, ethically produced food, full transparency about our farms
and standards, top-shelf service to our customers and care for our crew. Your hard work, crea vity and innova ve mindset have been
instrumental in helping us to arrive at this point, and we look forward to your con nued collabora on and contribu ons to help us get to the
next level and beyond.
 
Your new posi on will be Chief Marke ng Oﬃcer, repor ng into the Chief Execu ve Oﬃcer and performing such du es as are normally
associated with this posi on and such du es as are assigned to you from  me to  me. You will con nue to work remotely from your
residence in Aus n, Texas except as may be mutually agreed to by you and the Company. This is a full- me posi on. As an exempt salaried
employee, you will devote substan ally all of your business  me and a en on to the business of the Company and will not be eligible for
over me compensa on.
 
Your ini al base salary will be at the rate of $11,538.46 bi-weekly, which equates to $300,000 on an annualized basis (“Base Salary”),
payable in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll prac ces and subject to applicable deduc ons and withholdings. 
You will also be eligible to con nue to par cipate in the 401(k) plan maintained by the Company, which currently provides for a bi-weekly
employer contribu on equal to 3% of your earnings (subject to IRS employer contribu on limits), as well as a $40 per month internet
reimbursement (while working from home), a $40 per month cell-phone reimbursement, and reimbursement of other reasonable business
expenses in accordance with the Company’s policies on expense reimbursement. As a leader in our company, you will con nue to be eligible
for  me oﬀ under our management  me oﬀ policy and will not be subject to the standard PTO limits. You will con nue to be entrusted to
manage your work and  me oﬀ in accordance with such policy and the business and opera onal needs of the Company.
 
Addi onally, you will be eligible to earn a discre onary annual bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) at an annual target amount of 40% of your Base
Salary. Whether any Annual Bonus is awarded will be based upon the Company’s assessment of your performance and the Company’s
a ainment of goals as set by the Board of Directors in its sole discre on. Following the close of each ﬁscal year, the Company will
determine in its sole discre on whether it will award you an Annual Bonus and the amount of any such 

--- PAGE 102 ---
 
Annual Bonus. No amount of the Annual Bonus is guaranteed, and in addi on to the other condi ons for being awarded such compensa on,
you must be an employee in good standing on the Annual Bonus payment date to be eligible to earn and receive an Annual Bonus. No par al
or prorated bonuses will be provided. The Annual Bonus, if any, will be paid in accordance with the Company’s standard payroll prac ces,
including the withholding of any applicable deduc ons and taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Annual Bonus described above will be
payable commencing for ﬁscal year 2022. Provided you remain employed in good standing through the end of the year, you will be eligible
to receive an Annual Bonus, in an amount as determined by the Board of Directors based on goals set by the Board of Directors.
 
Subject to your con nued service with the Company and to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors (or authorized commi ee), for
ﬁscal year 2022, you will be granted an equity award to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Equity Award”) with a total
value of $225,000 on the grant date. The Equity Award will consist of an op on to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock (the
“Op on”) and a Restricted Stock Unit (the “RSU”) in a propor on to be determined by the Company’s Board. We expect that the Equity
Award will be granted in late March 2022 concurrently with the grant of equity awards to similarly situated execu ves. The exercise price
per share of the Op on will be equal to the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and the number of
shares subject to the Op on will be calculated using the Black Sholes model based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. The
number of shares of common stock subject to the RSU will be calculated based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. If
granted, the Op on and RSU will vest in three (3) equal annual installments, measured from the grant date, and subject to your con nued
service with the Company through each such ves ng date. The Op on and RSU will be subject to the terms and condi ons applicable to
such awards granted under the Company’s 2020 Equity Incen ve Plan (the “Equity Plan”) and the applicable award agreement. 
Your con nued employment is subject to the Company’s personnel policies and procedures as they may be interpreted, adopted, revised or
deleted from  me to  me in the Company’s sole discre on. You will con nue to be eligible to par cipate on the same basis as similarly-
situated employees in the Company’s beneﬁt plans in eﬀect from  me to  me during your employment. All ma ers of eligibility for coverage
or beneﬁts under any beneﬁt plan shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plan.
The Company reserves the right to change, alter, or terminate any beneﬁt plan in its sole discre on. An overview of our current beneﬁt
plans will be provided.
 
Your employment with the Company will, at all  mes, be “at will” which means that either you or the Company may terminate your
employment at any  me for any reason, with or without advance no ce. 
By signing this le er, you acknowledge that the terms described in this le er set forth the en re understanding between us and supersedes
any prior representa ons or agreements, whether wri en or oral; there are no terms, condi ons, representa ons, warran es or covenants
other than those contained herein. No term or provision of this le er may be amended, waived, released, discharged or modiﬁed except in
wri ng, signed by you and an authorized oﬃcer of the Company, except that the Company may, in its sole discre on, adjust the rate of pay,
salaries, incen ve compensa on, stock plans, beneﬁts, job  tles, loca ons, du es, responsibili es, and repor ng rela onships.
