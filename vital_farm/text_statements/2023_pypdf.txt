Subsequently, terms of the Credit Facility were modified at various times between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. Such amendments (i) amended various 
definitions, (ii) waived a technical default in May 2020 which was triggered by exceeding the capital expenditure limit, (iii) increased borrowing capacity and 
(iv) extended the maturity date. The Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility in April 2021 eliminated the term loan and equipment loan. The Tenth Amendment 
to the Credit Agreement in December 2022 modified certain covenants related to commodity hedging, consented to the dissolution of immaterial subsidiaries 
and implemented changes related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective July 26, 2023, extended the 
maturity date by one year, from April 2, 2024 to April 2, 2025.
The maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit is currently $20.0 million. Interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit, 
as well as loan advances thereunder, accrues at a rate, at our election at the time of borrowing, equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as administered 
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 2.00% or (ii) 1.00% plus the alternate base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility is secured by all of our assets (other than real property and certain other property excluded pursuant to the terms of the Credit 
Facility) and requires us to maintain three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net worth requirement. 
The Credit Facility also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, the sale of properties and 
liens. As a result of the limitations contained in the Credit Facility, certain of the net assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 are 
restricted in use. The Credit Facility contains other customary covenants, representations and events of default.
As of December 31, 2023, there was no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit 
Facility. See “Long-Term Debt” in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details related to 
our Credit Facility.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:
  Fiscal Year Ended  
  
December 31,
2023   
December 25,
2022  
  (in thousands)  
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  $ 50,906  $ (8,098)
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities   22,383   (10,037)
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities   (2,054)   83 
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents  $ 71,235  $ (18,052)
Operating Activities
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 
25, 2022 was due primarily to higher net income in the current fiscal year due to gross margin improvements and improving leverage our of selling, general and 
administrative costs. Increases in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the improved cash from operations, partially offset by an 
increase in our inventory. Our accrued liabilities were up across nearly all categories with the largest contributor being promotions and customer deductions.
Investing Activities
The increase in cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the continuing maturities of our 
available for sale securities and the reinvestment of these amounts into cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Financing Activities
The change in cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022 
was primarily due to an increase of principal payments on our finance lease obligations.

Seasonality
Demand for our products fluctuates in response to seasonal factors. Demand tends to increase with the start of the school year and is highest prior to 
holiday periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and is lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly 
fluctuations, comparisons of our sales and results of operations between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful 
comparisons.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts 
reported in the financial statements and related notes thereto. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that, in accordance with GAAP, involve a 
significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
Management has determined that our most critical accounting estimates are those relating to revenue recognition and trade promotions, income taxes, and 
contingencies. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results 
reported in future periods could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. For 
further discussion about our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Revenue Recognition and Trade Promotions
We recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has 
transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon delivery to the customer based on terms of the sale. Revenue is measured by the transaction price, 
which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price is adjusted for 
estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which include trade promotions as well as chargebacks such as coupons, discounts, rebates, spoils, and 
other programs. Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue, at the time of sale, based on the amount we expect to 
incur.
The transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration. We base these estimates on current forecasted activity and 
historical experience. We review our expected promotional rates and volumes each period, as well as our historical experience related to customer deductions 
for wrong, missing, damaged or aged product and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized. The impact of any 
adjustments is recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.
We do not believe it is reasonably likely that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above, 
estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a short duration and historical differences 
between actual experience compared to estimated volumes, performance and redemptions have not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial 
statements. However, if the level of redemption rates, volumes or performance were to vary significantly from our estimates, we may be exposed to gains or 
losses that could be material. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal 
years.
Income Taxes
We determine our effective tax rate by estimating our permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax 
purposes. We are periodically audited by taxing authorities and consider any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing our income tax expense. 
Any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on our effective tax rate.
Deferred income taxes relate primarily to depreciation expense and share-based compensation programs accounted for differently for financial and 
income tax purposes. Changes in tax laws and rates could materially affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Valuation allowances are 
recorded when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. Changes in projected future earnings could affect our 
recorded valuation allowances, if any, in the future.
We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues for which the benefit is more likely than not based on our analysis of 
whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result 
in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit 
liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period 
could be materially affected.
60

Contingencies
We recognize the costs of legal defense for the legal proceedings to which we are a party during the periods in which the costs are incurred. After 
considerable analysis of the facts and circumstances of each case, we determine the amount of reserves required, if any. We evaluate whether a loss contingency 
exists, and if the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably 
estimated, the estimated loss would be accrued.
There were no loss contingency reserves for the past three fiscal years. In May 2021, the Company and certain of its current and former officers were 
named as defendants in a class action complaint captioned Nicholas A. Usler et al. v. Vital Farms, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the Western 
District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged false advertising claims on behalf of themselves and a putative class of alleged consumers of the Company’s shell egg 
products. The named officers of the Company were subsequently dismissed as defendants in this matter. In September 2023, the parties engaged in mediation to 
discuss potential settlement of remaining claims, but no agreement was reached and the lawsuit is ongoing. The Company believes the claims are without merit 
and is vigorously defending itself in this matter. Given the uncertainty of the litigation, the stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among 
other things, class certification and success on the merits, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result 
from the claim. Future reserves may be required if losses are deemed reasonably estimable and probable due to changes in our assumptions, the effectiveness of 
legal strategies, or other factors beyond our control. Future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of reserves or by accruals of losses 
to reflect any adverse determinations in these legal proceedings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See the sections titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” and “—Recently Issued 
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted” in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of 
recent accounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may take advantage of the 
extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging 
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to 
use the extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public 
companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due 
to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates.
Commodity Price Risk
We source our eggs and cream for our butter products from our network of family farms. The price we pay to purchase shell eggs from farmers 
fluctuates based on pallet weight, and under our buy-sell contracts, which account for all of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December 31, 
2023, the price we pay is also adjusted quarterly for changes in feed cost, which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate on a 
quarterly basis. Our buy-sell contracts subject us to risk of price fluctuations in feed ingredients, primarily consisting of corn and soy. The price we pay for 
cream is subject to butter commodity fluctuations. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these ingredients across our product 
lines as of December 31, 2023 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately 
$8.8 million. We strive to offset the impact of ingredient cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our 
customers.
Costs of packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict creating price risk. A hypothetical 10% increase or 
decrease in the weighted-average cost of packaging raw materials as of December 31, 2023 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for 
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately $3.5 million. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw materials cost increases with a combination of 
negotiated pricing agreements, cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.
61

--- PAGE 63 ---
 
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility. See the 
section titled “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facility” above for additional details related to our Credit Facility. Based on the average interest rate 
on the instruments under the Credit Facility during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not 
believe that a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2023. 
Our interest-earning instruments also carry a degree of interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $84.1 million 
and investments in available for sale securities of $32.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, the effective maturity of our investment securities available for sale 
was approximately 4 months and the composite credit rating of the holdings is Aa3 on the Moody's rating scale.
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate 
risk exposure during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Vital Farms, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vital Farms, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and December 
25, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows 
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our 
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 
December 25, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity 
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to 
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, 
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in 
the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.

VITAL FARMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Vital Farms, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on June 6, 2013 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The 
Company packages, markets and distributes shell eggs, butter and other products. These products are principally sold under the name Vital Farms in addition to 
other trade names, primarily to retail and foodservice channels in the United States.
Vital Farms of Missouri, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vital Farms. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
in the audited consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“U.S. GAAP” or “GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain 
information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant 
to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the included disclosures are adequate, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2023, consolidated results of operations and the 
consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021. Such adjustments are of a normal and 
recurring nature and certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. A reclassification of 
$1,539 has been made from accounts receivable, net to prepaids and other current assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2022 to 
conform to the current year presentation of our accounts receivable from the Company's network of farms.
Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December and contains either 52 or 53 weeks. Therefore, the financial results of 
certain 53-week fiscal years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 contains 
operating results for 53 weeks, while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021 contain operating results for 52 weeks.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition, determination of useful lives for 
property and equipment, trade spend accruals, goodwill, allowance for credit losses, inventory obsolescence, stock option valuations, accrued liabilities, income 
taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentrations of Customers and Risk: A substantial amount of our shell egg processing occurs at our Egg Central Station shell egg processing 
facility. Any shutdown or period of reduced production at Egg Central Station, which may be caused by regulatory noncompliance or other issues, as well as 
factors beyond our control, such as natural disaster, weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, disease outbreaks or pandemics, equipment failure or 
delay in raw materials delivery, would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner, meet our contractual obligations and operate 
our business. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, 
accounts receivable and derivative instruments. The Company maintains deposits with large financial institutions that the Company believes are of high credit 
quality. At times the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of federally insured limits. The Company 
has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents balances.
The Company's customer concentration for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months 
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United States. As of December 31, 2023 and December 
25, 2022, cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with balances denominated in U.S. dollars and investments in money market funds.
Investment Securities: The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities. The 
Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company’s ability to sell 
within the next 12 months, as available-for-sale. The Company classifies these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for current 
operations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other comprehensive income until the 
security is settled or sold, except for changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are reported on a gross basis in other expense.
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in 
interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method with realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and 
declines in value due to credit-related factors, reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income when sold and recorded in other income. Income tax 
effects related to realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are released from accumulated other comprehensive income quarterly with the 
recognition of the Company’s tax provision. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in interest income.
Variable Interest Entity: The Company consolidates all entities where a controlling financial interest exists. The Company has considered its 
relationship with Ovabrite, Inc. to determine whether the Company has a variable interest in that entity, and if so, whether the Company is the primary 
beneficiary of the relationship. GAAP requires variable interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated if an entity’s interest in the VIE is a controlling financial 
interest. Under the variable model, a controlling financial interest is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE 
that most significantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the 
right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Management performs ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE will 
cause the consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of a VIE may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status 
are applied prospectively in accordance with GAAP.
Segment Information: The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment. The Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of evaluating financial performance and 
allocating resources. All of the Company’s long-lived assets and customers are located in the United States.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined below:
• Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for 
similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated 
by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of 
the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.
72

--- PAGE 74 ---
 
The carrying values of cash, trade receivables, other non-trade receivables within prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued 
expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers net of any allowance for credit losses. The Company generally 
does not have collateral for its receivables, but the Company does periodically evaluate the creditworthiness of its customers.
Allowance for Credit Losses: The allowance for expected credit losses related to trade receivables is estimated based on the trade receivable aging 
category, credit risk of specific customers, past collection history, and management’s evaluation of accounts receivable. The evaluation is inherently subjective, 
as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The provision for expected credit losses is charged 
within selling, general and administrative costs. These losses have been immaterial to date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. 
The allowance for expected credit losses related to other non-trade receivables are estimated based on the aging category and the probability of default. 
Provisions for current estimated credit losses are classified within selling, general and administrative costs.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under the weighted average cost method) or net realizable value. In addition to 
product cost, inventory costs include expenditures such as in-bound shipping and handling and warehousing costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its 
existing condition and location. Inventory includes eggs and egg-related products, butter and butter-related products, packaging, feed, laying hens, pullets, and 
equipment parts. A reduction in the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to net realizable value is recorded in cost of goods sold with the offset to 
inventory. Any inventory that does not meet the quality control standards of the Company is separated and written down to its net realizable value.
Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to reduce its exposure to 
commodity price risk. Business operations give rise to certain market exposures, mostly due to changes in commodity prices of corn and soybean meal. Credit 
risks associated with derivative contracts are not significant, as the Company minimizes counterparty exposure by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and 
collateralized insurers and by utilizing exchange traded instruments and insurance backed commodity settlement contracts. While the Company may be exposed 
to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by these counterparties, losses are not anticipated. The Company does not hold derivative 
instruments for trading purposes. Additionally, the Company’s derivative contracts are short-term in duration and do not make use of credit-risk-related 
contingent features.
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these 
derivatives are recorded as incurred within other expense, net. Net realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are reported as a reconciling item from 
net income to cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to settlements and purchases of derivative 
instruments are reported as investing activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.  
Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and 
amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The general range of useful lives of other property, plant and 
equipment is as follows:
   
   Estimated Useful Life
Land   N/A
Land improvements  15 to 20 years
Buildings and improvements   15 to 39 years
Vehicles   5 years
Machinery and equipment   2 to 7 years
Furniture and fixtures   5 years
Leasehold improvements   Lesser of lease term or 5 years
When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, with 
any resulting gain or loss recorded in operations in the consolidated statements of income. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred to 
operations.
73

--- PAGE 75 ---
 
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s goodwill impairment test is performed at the enterprise level given the single 
reporting unit.
The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances existed that would lead the Company to conclude that it is 
more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair 
value of the reporting unit is below the carrying amount based on qualitative factors or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting 
unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill assessment would be required. In the quantitative evaluation, the fair value of 
the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to be 
recoverable and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which 
the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value and a charge is reported as impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statements of income. To 
date, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges associated with its goodwill.
Leases: The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to 
and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. Under ASC 842, Leases (“Topic 842”), a contract is or contains a lease when (i) explicitly or 
implicitly identified assets have been deployed in the contract and (ii) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that 
underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract. The Company also considers whether its service 
arrangements include the right to control the use of an asset.
The Company has made an accounting policy election not to recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 
months or less. For all other leases, the Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at 
the commencement date of the lease. The Company’s recognized ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date, which are reduced by any lease incentives.
Future lease payments may include fixed rent escalation clauses or payments that depend on an index (such as the Consumer Price Index measured by 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). Subsequent index changes and other periodic market-rate adjustments to base rent are recorded as variable lease expense 
during the period in which they are incurred. Residual value guarantees or payments for terminating the lease are included in the lease payments only when it is 
probable they will be incurred.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to account for lease and non-lease components in its contracts as a single lease component for all 
asset classes. The non-lease components typically represent additional services transferred to the Company, such as common area maintenance for real estate, 
which are variable in nature and recorded in variable lease expense in the period incurred.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events and 
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use 
and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an 
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current 
operating results, trends and prospects and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company did not recognize an 
impairment loss during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021.
Noncontrolling Interest: The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to VIEs, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as equity 
in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity’s equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is 
included in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the parent entity’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that 
do not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, when a subsidiary is 
deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between the 
carrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss. Affiliate equity interests where the Company has certain rights to demand 
settlement are presented at their current redemption values, as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Because these transactions 
take place between entities under common control, any gains or losses attributable to these transactions are required to be included within additional paid-in-
capital on the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the 
expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences, the 
Company considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded, if necessary, to reduce 
net deferred tax assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.
74

--- PAGE 76 ---
 
The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained 
upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. Assessing an uncertain tax position 
begins with the initial determination of the sustainability of the position and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being 
realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed. Additionally, the Company must accrue 
interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 
2023 and December 25, 2022 the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions of $171 and $85.
Net Income per Share Attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. Common Stockholders: The Company applies the two-class method to compute basic and 
diluted net income per share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders when shares meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class 
method determines net income per share for each class of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock according to dividends declared or accumulated 
and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated 
between the Company’s common stock and preferred stock based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income for the period had been 
distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the preferred stock does not have a contractual obligation to 
share in the Company’s losses.
Basic net income per share attributable to the Company’s stockholders is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares 
outstanding during the period without consideration of potentially dilutive common stock. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could 
occur if securities or other contracts to issue shares of the Company’s common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance 
of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company unless inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company 
reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders is the same as basic net loss, because potentially 
dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of products to its customers, which include natural channel retailers, 
mainstream channel retailers and foodservice customers. The Company sells its products to customers on a purchase-order basis.
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and the related performance obligation is satisfied, which typically 
occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer, for an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for delivering 
the product. The Company offers sales incentives through various programs to customers and allow deductions from its customers, which may include credits 
or discounts to customers in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer’s site. The cost associated with 
promotions and chargebacks is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue and is recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally 
precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of this cost therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will 
be redeemed. Differences between estimated cost and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.
In many cases, key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a regular basis such that most customer arrangements and 
related incentives have a duration of less than one year. Amounts billed and due from customers are short-term in nature and are classified as receivables since 
payments are unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payments are due.
Treasury Stock: The Company records treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury 
stock. The Company’s accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from the Company’s common stock and to 
reflect any excess of cost over par value as a reduction to additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares).
Shipping and Distribution: The Company’s shipping and distribution costs include costs incurred with third-party carriers to transport products to 
customers and salaries and overhead costs related to activities to prepare the Company’s products for shipment. Shipping and distribution costs were $27,344, 
$30,104, and $24,979 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, respectively. Freight-in costs are included 
within cost of goods sold and were $4,823, $9,610, and $7,623 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, 
respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation: The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value on 
the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the 
respective award. Stock options generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards 
generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant and contain no other service or performance conditions. The Company recognizes stock-based 
compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service or vesting period. Forfeitures for stock options and restricted stock awards are 
recognized as they occur. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, 
which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the fair market value of the Company’s common stock, expected stock price volatility, 
the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company’s expected dividend 
yield. The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of income in the same manner in which the award recipient’s 
payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
Advertising and Promotion Expenses: Advertising and promotion expenses consist primarily of production costs and the costs to communicate the 
advertisements to promote and market the Company’s products. Production costs such as idea development, artwork, audio and video crews and other upfront 
development costs are expensed the first time the associated advertising campaign is launched or aired. The costs to communicate the advertisements such as 
airtime and distribution costs are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, the 
Company incurred advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $23,625, $13,301, and $11,469, respectively.
Emerging Growth Company Status: The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 
(“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as those 
standards apply to private companies.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), 
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2018-19, ASU 
2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02, ASU 2020-03 and ASU 2022-02 (collectively, “Topic 326”), to introduce a new 
impairment model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses. Topic 326 requires financial 
assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant 
information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the 
reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The 
Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on December 26, 2022. Entities will apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as 
of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. There was no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at 
adoption.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”), 
which intends to simplify the guidance by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying or amending existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 is 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.  The Company 
adopted ASU 2019-12 during fiscal year 2022 and there was no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended 
December 25, 2022 and December 31, 2023.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) 
— Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”) in order to improve stockholders’ understanding of an entity’s business activities 
through enhanced disclosures around reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 will require incremental and more detailed disclosure regarding segment expenses on 
both an annual and interim basis. For public companies ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within 
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the standard for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company is 
currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”) in 
order to enhance the transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is applicable to all entities subject to income tax and it will require 
disclosure of certain categories within the rate reconciliation to improve consistency as well as disclosure of reconciling items which meet a certain quantitative 
threshold which will improve transparency. Additionally, entities must disclose the amount of taxes paid to federal, state and foreign municipalities. For public 
business entities ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects to adopt the standard for the fiscal 
year beginning December 30, 2024.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial 
statements.

Total  $ 31,657  $ (888)  $ 33,582  $ (1,136)  $ 65,239  $ (2,024)
As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, there were 47 diversified issuances in the Company’s securities portfolio in an unrealized loss position, 
with credit ratings from BBB- to AAA. As of December 31, 2023, there are no individual bonds with unrealized losses exceeding $46, and 46 issuances have 
been in a loss position greater than 12 months.
The decline in fair value has resulted primarily from rising interest rates over the last 12 months, and the Company does not believe there has been any 
significant decline in the creditworthiness of the issuers. The Company also does not believe it is likely that a significant number of bonds will be called early, 
and it does not have liquidity needs that would necessitate a sale of any material investments prior to maturity. Therefore, the Company has not recorded an 
allowance for credit losses on the investment securities as of December 31, 2023.
The fair value and location of all investment securities are included in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 5 below.
4. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility. Such instruments may include call options on 
commodity price contracts. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are 
recorded in other expense, net. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities.
The following table presents the aggregated outstanding notional amounts related to the Company’s derivative financial instruments for the periods 
presented:

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, the pre-tax amount of commodity contract derivative losses 
recognized in other expense, net was $2,435, $0, and $0, respectively.
The fair value and location of all outstanding derivative financial instruments are included in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 5 below.
5. Fair Value Measurements
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into 
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, 
including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.

concentrations of credit risk for the Company’s financial instruments, refer to “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 2 and “Investment 
Securities” in Note 3 above.
Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments
The carrying values of the Company’s short-term financial instruments not included above, including cash, trade receivables, other non-trade receivables 
included in prepaid expense and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to their 
short-term nature.
6. Revenue Recognition
The following table summarizes the Company’s net revenue by primary product for the periods presented:
  Fiscal Year Ended  
  
December 31,
2023   
December 25,
2022   
December 26,
2021  
Net Revenue:          
Eggs and egg-related products  $ 449,045  $ 339,214  $ 239,967 
Butter and butter-related products   22,812   22,836   20,934 
Net Revenue  $ 471,857  $ 362,050  $ 260,901 
Net revenue is primarily generated from the sale of eggs and butter. The Company’s product offerings include shell eggs, hard-boiled eggs, liquid whole 
eggs, and stick butter. The Company’s previous convenient breakfast product line (including egg bites and egg-based breakfast bars) was discontinued in 2022, 
and the Company’s ghee and spreadable tub butter offerings were discontinued during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The revenues related to the 
discontinued product lines were immaterial.

7. Allowance for Credit Losses
As of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $777 and $699, respectively.
The Company recognizes current estimated credit losses (“CECL”) for accounts receivable. The CECL for trade receivables are estimated based on the 
trade receivable aging category, credit risk of specific customers, past collection history, and management’s evaluation of accounts receivable. The Company 
also has other receivables which are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets. The CECL for other receivables are estimated based on the 
other receivables aging category and the probability of default. Provisions for CECL are classified within selling, general and administrative costs.
Changes in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented were as follows:
  
Accounts

9. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment consisted of the following as of the periods presented:
  
December 31,
2023   
December 25,
2022  
Land  $ 552  $ 552 
Land improvements   818   835

Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization   (21,051)   (12,687)
Property, plant and equipment, net  $ 66,839  $ 59,155 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and 
equipment was approximately $7,925, $5,441, and $3,540, respectively.
10. Leases
The Company leases office facilities, warehouses, office equipment and vehicles for delivery of products under lease agreements with initial terms 
approximating one to five years. The Company's finance leases include leases on a transportation fleet as well as office equipment and its operating leases 
primarily consist of leases on its buildings, including its corporate headquarters.
In addition, substantially all the Company’s long-term supply contracts with farms contain components that meet the definition of embedded leases 
within the scope of Topic 842. These arrangements convey to the Company the right to control implicitly identified property, plant and equipment as it takes 
substantially all the utility generated by these assets over the term of the arrangements at a variable price. The initial term of these supply agreements ranges 
from one to seven years. Excluding upfront leasing costs discussed below, the total purchase commitments contained in these arrangements are variable and 
represent rentals; there are no minimum purchase commitments associated with these long-term supply contracts. During December 2023, the Company 
executed two long-term supply contracts with farms to provide an upfront lease payment to offset farm construction costs, loans and other startup costs. The 
upfront leasing costs have been classified within our operating lease right-of-use assets on the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2023 
and will be amortized to cost of goods sold over the term of the long term supply arrangements.
As the classification and timing of recognition of costs attributable to the eggs and embedded cost of the lease rentals are identical, the Company does 
not allocate the total purchase cost of eggs between the cost of the eggs and the embedded cost of the lease rentals or distinguish between them in its accounting 
records. The Company records the total purchase cost of eggs, which includes costs associated with the eggs and the corresponding cost of embedded lease 
rentals from the same arrangement, into inventory. These costs are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggs are sold to customers and are also 
reported as part of our variable lease cost.
The Company’s office lease for its corporate headquarters facility in Austin, Texas includes an option to renew, generally at the Company's sole 
discretion, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. In addition, certain leases contain termination options, where the rights to 
terminate are held by the Company, the lessor, or both parties. These options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease terms when it is reasonably 
certain that the Company will exercise that option. As of December 31, 2023, it is not reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the right to extend its 
office lease and therefore, the Company has not included the extended term in the calculation of its ROU assets or liabilities. The Company’s leases do not 
contain any material restrictive covenants or residual value guarantees.
Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and finance lease cost is recognized as amortization expense for ROU 
assets and interest expense associated with finance lease liabilities. Amortization expense associated with our finance leases during the fiscal years ended 
December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 was $2,565 and $439, respectively, and is recorded within costs of goods sold and selling, general and 
administrative costs in the consolidated statement of income.

12. Product Exit Costs
During the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022, the Company made the decision to exit its convenient breakfast product category due to a shift in focus 
to product offerings that are core to the Company’s operations. Charges incurred in connection with these product exits were substantially complete by 
December 25, 2022, and the Company believes the actual charges as shown below approximate fair value. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made the decision to exit its ghee and spreadable tub butter product offerings. Charges 
incurred in connection with these product exits were immaterial.
As of December 25, 2022, the ending liability balance related to the convenience breakfast category exit was $119. As of December 31, 2023, remaining 
liabilities of $45 are expected to be settled or released by the end of the 13-week period ending March 31, 2024.

13. Long-Term Debt
In October 2017, the Company entered into a credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (the “Credit Facility”) that initially 
included a $4.7 million term a loan, a $10.0 million revolving line of credit and an equipment loan with a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.5 million.
Subsequently, the terms of the Credit Facility were modified at various times between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. Such amendments (i) amended 
various definitions, (ii) waived a technical default in May 2020 which was triggered by exceeding the capital expenditure limit, (iii) increased borrowing 
capacity and (iv) extended the maturity date. The Ninth Amendment to the Credit Facility in April 2021 eliminated the term loan and equipment loan. The Tenth 
Amendment to the Credit Facility in December 2022 modified certain covenants related to commodity hedging, consented to the dissolution of immaterial 
subsidiaries and implemented changes related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Facility, effective July 26, 2023 
extended the maturity date by one year, from April 2, 2024 to April 2, 2025.
The maximum borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit is currently $20.0 million. Interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit, 
as well as loan advances thereunder, accrues at a rate, at the Company’s election at the time of borrowing, equal to (i) the secured overnight financing rate as 
administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 2.00% or (ii) 1.00% plus the alternate base rate, as defined in the Credit Facility. During the fiscal 
year ended December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed and repaid $7.5 million under the revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2023, there were no 
outstanding amounts under the revolving line of credit.
The Credit Facility is secured by all of the Company’s assets (other than real property and certain other property excluded pursuant to the terms of the 
Credit Facility) and requires the Company to maintain three financial covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and a minimum tangible net 
worth requirement. The Credit Facility also contains various covenants relating to limitations on indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and the sale 
of properties and liens. As a result of the limitations contained in the Credit Facility, certain of the net assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2023 are restricted in use. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries are non-operating and have no restricted net assets within the meaning of 
Rule 4-08(e)(3) or Rule 12-04 of Regulation S-X. The Credit Facility also contains other customary covenants, representations and events of default. As of 
December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.

Options vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2023   3,920,485  $ 10.07   5.8  $ 28,749 
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, which uses the 
expected option term, stock price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected option term assumption reflects the period for which the Company 
believes the option will remain outstanding. The Company elected to use the simplified method to determine the expected option term, for all periods presented, 
which is the average of the option’s vesting and contractual term. The Company’s computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of 
selected comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of the option. The risk-free interest rate reflects the U.S. Treasury yield 
curve for a similar instrument with the same expected term in effect at the time of the grant.
The following table summarizes the valuation model assumptions, fair values and intrinsic values of stock options during the fiscal years indicated:
  
December 31,

As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $3,412, which is expected to be 
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.62 years.

As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s unvested RSU activity was $5,220, which is 
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.76 years.
The fair value of RSU shares vested during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021 was $3,044, $1,549, 
and $564, respectively.
2020 Equity Incentive Plan: In July 2020, the Board of Directors adopted the Vital Farms, Inc. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Incentive Plan”), 
which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders and became effective on July 30, 2020. Initially, the maximum number of shares of the 
Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2020 Incentive Plan was 8,595,871 shares. The 2020 Incentive Plan provides that the number of shares 
reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 Incentive Plan will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on (and 
including) January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to 4% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31 or 
such lesser number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2023, 11,200,932 shares were available for future grants of the

shares of the Company’s common stock to certain eligible employees or, as designated by the Board of Directors, employees of a related company. The 2020 
ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance under the 2020 ESPP will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on 
January 1, 2021 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2030, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the outstanding number of shares of common 
stock on the immediately preceding December 31 and (ii) 900,000, or such lesser number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. As of December 
31, 2023, 2,112,394 shares of the Company’s common stock were available for future issuance, which excludes 416,846 shares of common stock that were 
automatically added to the available reserve on January 1, 2024. The Board of Directors authorizes six-month offering periods, with the most recent beginning 
on November 16, 2023.

State   (207)   (125)   (371)
Provision (benefit) for income taxes  $ 6,635  $ 1,601  $ (2,028)
The Company’s income before income taxes is entirely derived from domestic sources for all periods presented. The reconciliation of the federal 
statutory income tax provision to the Company’s effective income tax provision is as follows:
  
December 31,
2023

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 
31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 were comprised of the following:

Intangibles    507   430 
Total deferred tax liabilities   $ 13,292  $ 9,882 
Net deferred tax liabilities   $ (371)  $ (170)
A valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A full review of all positive and negative 
evidence needs to be considered, including the Company’s current and past performance, the market environments in which the Company operates, the 
utilization of past tax credits, the length of carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that might be implemented. Management 
considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.
The activity in the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022 was as 
follows:
  
December 31,
2023   
December 25,
2022  
Valuation allowance as of beginning of year  $ —  $ 774 
Increases recorded to income tax provision   84   — 
Decreases recorded as benefit to income tax provision   —   (774)
Valuation allowance as of end of year  $ 84  $ — 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, which represent the aggregate tax effect of the differences between tax return 
positions and the benefits recognized in the Company’s financial statements. At December 31, 2023, all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would 
affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and the Company does not anticipate the balance of the 
unrecognized tax benefits to change materially in the next 12 months.

The Company files a U.S. federal income tax return, as well as income tax returns in various states. Tax years 2020 and forward remain open to 
examination by the tax jurisdictions to which the Company is subject, with certain state taxing jurisdictions being open back to 2017.

20. Commitments and Contingencies
Supplier Contracts: The Company purchases its egg inventories under long-term supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in 
these arrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. Accordingly, there are no estimable future purchase commitments 
associated with these supplier contracts and there are no minimum payments associated with these long-term supply contracts. The Company records the total 
cost of eggs into inventory and they are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggs are sold to customers and are also reported as part of the 
Company’s variable lease cost. During December 2023, the Company executed two long-term supply contracts with farms to provide a one-time payment of 
$200,000 each at lease inception as an incremental cost of obtaining the lease.
Indemnification Agreements: In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, 
lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from 
intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its 
Board of Directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by 
reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these 
indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such 
indemnification agreements.
91

--- PAGE 94 ---
 
Litigation: The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies that are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to its business, 
including those related to regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee-related matters and taxes, among others. When the Company becomes aware of 
a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as 
appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of 
management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates.
On May 20, 2021, the Company and certain of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a class action complaint captioned Nicholas 
A. Usler et al. v. Vital Farms, Inc. et al. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The plaintiffs alleged false advertising claims on 
behalf of themselves and a putative class of alleged consumers of the Company’s eggs. The named officers of the Company were subsequently dismissed as 
defendants in this matter. In September 2023, the parties engaged in mediation to discuss potential settlement of remaining claims, but no agreement was 
reached and the lawsuit is ongoing. The Company believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending itself in this matter. Given the uncertainty 
of the litigation, the stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, the 
Company is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, that may result from the claim.
Although the Company maintains insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities 
and is subject to various exclusions and caps on amounts recoverable. Even if the Company believes a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute its 
entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of the Company's recovery. If it is 
probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or 
the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible.
21. Related Party Transactions
Ovabrite: Ovabrite, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ovabrite”), has been deemed a related party because its founders were stockholders of the Company, 
with the majority stockholder in Ovabrite also serving as the Company’s executive chairperson and member of the Board of Directors. Since Ovabrite’s 
incorporation in November 2016, the Company has been deemed to have had a variable interest in Ovabrite, and Ovabrite has been deemed to have been a VIE, 
of which the Company has been the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated the results of Ovabrite since November 2016. All 
significant intercompany transactions between the Company and Ovabrite have been eliminated in consolidation.
Effective August 30, 2022, Ovabrite’s Board of Directors and the holders of the majority of its outstanding capital stock consented to dissolving the 
entity, and a Certificate of Dissolution was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State. As of December 31, 2023, Ovabrite had completed its business activities 
and liquidated its remaining assets. The results of operations of the Ovabrite entity were immaterial for all periods presented.
Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc.: The Company utilizes Sandpebble Builders Preconstruction, Inc. and Sandpebble South, Inc. (collectively 
“Sandpebble”) for project management and related services associated with the construction and expansion of our egg processing facilities, including site 
selection, project management and related services for the Company’s potential future egg packing facility. The Company's contract with Sandpebble for 
services related to the Company's next egg packing facility was awarded after a competitive bidding process. Victor Canseco, the owner and principal of 
Sandpebble, is the father of Russell Diez-Canseco, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors. In 
connection with the services described above, the Company paid Sandpebble $631, $962, and $1,037 during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, 
December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, respectively. Amounts paid to Sandpebble are included in property, plant and equipment, net and selling, general 
and administrative costs. As of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, amounts owed to Sandpebble were $0 and $51, respectively, 
and are included in accounts payable.
Whole Foods Market, Inc: A member of the Board of Directors was, until February 2022, an executive vice president and senior advisor at Whole 
Foods. The Company serves the majority of its natural channel retail customers through food distributors, such as US Foods Inc. and United Natural Foods, 
Inc., who purchase, store, sell and deliver products to Whole Foods. While the Company cannot precisely determine its specific revenue attributable to Whole 
Foods, it is a significant customer.
22. 401(k) Savings Plan
The Company established a defined contribution savings plan in 2017 under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This 
plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual 
compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the fiscal years ended 
December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022, and December 26, 2021, the Company made contributions totaling $1,185, $861, and $651 respectively, to the plan.

Exhibit 97
V     F    , I  .
I         C            R          P     
1. I           
The Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Vital Farms, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt this Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (this “Policy”) providing for the Company’s recoupment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation that is received by Covered Officers of the Company under certain circumstances. Certain capitalized terms used in this Policy have the meanings given to such terms in Section 3 below.
This Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder (“Rule 10D-1”) and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5608 (the “Listing Standards”).
2. E         D   
This Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation that is received by a Covered Officer on or after October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).  This Policy shall replace and supersede the Company’s Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy that was adopted on November 14, 2022 (the “Prior Clawback Policy”) with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is received by a Covered Officer on or after the Effective Date; for clarity, the Prior Clawback Policy shall continue to apply to any Incentive Compensation that is received by a Covered Officer prior to the Effective Date.  Incentive Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period in which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period.
3. D          
“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement that the Company is required to prepare due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.
“Accounting Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (a) the date that the Board, a committee of the Board authorized to take such action, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (b) the date that a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.
“Administrator” means the Compensation Committee or, in the absence of such committee, the Board.
“Code” means the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
 

--- PAGE 107 ---
“Covered Officer” means each current and former Executive Officer.
“Exchange” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.
“Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
“Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. Identification of an executive officer for purposes of this Policy would include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.
“Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures, including Company stock price and total stockholder return (“TSR”). A measure need not be presented in the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC in order to be a Financial Reporting Measure.
“Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 
“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Date, as well as any transition period (resulting from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lookback Period shall not include fiscal years completed prior to the Effective Date. 
“Recoverable Incentive Compensation” means Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Officer during the Lookback Period that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that would have been received had such amount been determined based on the Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a gross basis without regarding to tax withholdings and other deductions). For any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation for purposes of this Policy shall include, without limitation, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive Compensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator will determine the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive Compensation was received. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Listing Standards.
“SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
4. R         
(a)Applicability of Policy. This Policy applies to Incentive Compensation received by a 
2
 

--- PAGE 108 ---
Covered Officer (i) after beginning services as an Executive Officer, (ii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive Compensation, (iii) while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (iv) during the Lookback Period. 
(b)Recoupment Generally.  Pursuant to the provisions of this Policy, if there is an Accounting Restatement, the Company must reasonably promptly recoup the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, unless the conditions of one or more subsections of Section 4(c) of this Policy are met and the Compensation Committee, or, if such committee does not consist solely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has made a determination that recoupment would be impracticable. Recoupment is required regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of fault, and the Company’s obligation to recoup Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not dependent on whether or when any restated financial statements are filed.  
(c)Impracticability of Recovery. Recoupment may be determined to be impracticable if, and only if:
(i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount of the applicable Recoverable Incentive Compensation; provided that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company shall make a reasonable attempt to recover such Recoverable Incentive Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Listing Standards; or
(ii) recoupment of the applicable Recoverable Incentive Compensation would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(13) or Code Section 411(a) and regulations thereunder.
(d)Sources of Recoupment.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrator shall, in its sole discretion, determine the timing and method for recouping Recoverable Incentive Compensation hereunder, provided that such recoupment is undertaken reasonably promptly. The Administrator may, in its discretion, seek recoupment from a Covered Officer from any of the following sources or a combination thereof, whether the applicable compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Officer prior to, on or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered Officer; (ii) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A; and (v) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with any applicable law, the Administrator may effectuate recoupment under this Policy from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Officer, including amounts payable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, e.g., base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by the Covered Officer. The Administrator need not utilize the same method of recovery for all Covered Officers or with respect to all types of Recoverable Incentive Compensation.
(e)No Indemnification of Covered Officers. Notwithstanding any indemnification agreement, applicable insurance policy or any other agreement or provision of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws to the contrary, no Covered Officer shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any enforcement of this Policy by the Company, including 
3
 

--- PAGE 109 ---
paying or reimbursing such Covered Officer for insurance premiums to cover potential obligations to the Company under this Policy.
(f) Indemnification of Administrator. Any members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under applicable law or Company policy.
5. A             
Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Administrator. The Administrator shall have full and final authority to make any and all determinations required under this Policy.  Any determination by the Administrator with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested parties and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. In carrying out the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).
6. S           
If any provision of this Policy or the application of any such provision to a Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.
7. N  I             O     R       
Nothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as contemplated herein, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company or any of its affiliates may have against a Covered Officer arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the Covered Officer. This Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce a Covered Officer’s obligations to the Company, including, without limitation, termination of employment and/or institution of civil proceedings. This Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and to any other compensation recoupment policy and/or similar provisions in any employment, equity plan, equity award, or other individual agreement, to which the Company is a party or which the Company has adopted or may adopt and maintain from time to time.
8. A        ; T          
The Administrator may amend, terminate or replace this Policy or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion. The Administrator shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any Listing Standard.
4
 

--- PAGE 110 ---
9. S         
This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers and, to the extent required by Rule 10D-1 and/or the applicable Listing Standards, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
10. R        F      
The Company shall make any disclosures and filings with respect to this Policy that are required by law, including as required by the SEC.
 
Approved by Compensation Committee:  November 13, 2023
