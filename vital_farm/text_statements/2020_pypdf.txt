Seasonality
Demand for our products fluctuates in response to seasonal factors. Demand tends to increase with the start of the school year and is highest prior toholiday periods, particularly Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter and the lowest during the summer months. As a result of these seasonal and quarterlyfluctuations, comparisons of our sales and results of operations between different quarters within a single fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful comparisons.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships withunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established forthe purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amountsreported in those financial statements and related notes thereto. The future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, cash flows and financialposition are unclear. However, we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Although webelieve that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods coulddiffer from those estimates. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition, determination of useful lives for property and equipment, goodwill, contingentconsideration, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, valuation of common stock, stock option valuations, redeemable noncontrolling interest,accrual liabilities and income taxes.
The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in our audited consolidatedfinancial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, and the notes thereto. Except as detailed in Note 2 to our consolidated financialstatements included in this Annual Report, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the fiscal year ended December 27,2020.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See the sections titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recently adopted accounting pronouncements” and     “—Recently issuedaccounting pronouncements not yet adopted” in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of recentaccounting pronouncements.
Emerging Growth Company Status
In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” may take advantage of the extendedtransition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Therefore, an emerging growthcompany can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use theextended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies thatcomply with such new or revised accounting standards.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due toadverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in raw materials, ingredients, inflation andinterest rates.
Raw Materials Pricing Risk
The packaging materials used for our products include cardboard, glass, corrugated fiberboard, kraft paper, flexible plastic, flexible film and paperboard.These raw materials are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these rawmaterials as of December 27, 2020 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the year ended December 27, 2020 of approximately $1.6million. We seek to mitigate the impact of raw materials cost increases by negotiating pricing agreements. We strive to offset the impact of raw materials costincreases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.

--- PAGE 61 ---
Ingredient Risk
We source our pasture-raised eggs and milk for our products from our network of small family farms. The price we pay to purchase shell eggs from farmersfluctuates based on pallet weight, and under our buy-sell contracts, which account for 98% of the laying hens in our network of family farms as of December 27,2020, the price we pay is also indexed quarterly in arrears for changes in feed cost, which may cause our agreed-upon pricing under these contracts to fluctuate ona quarterly basis. Under the remainder of our contracts, we are directly responsible for purchasing feed. Either type of contract subjects us to risk of pricefluctuations in feed ingredients, primarily consisting of corn and soy. We do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of these ingredients by usingfuture, forward, option or other derivative instruments. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the weighted-average cost of these ingredients as ofDecember 27, 2020 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales for the year ended December 27, 2020 of approximately $3.4 million. We striveto offset the impact of ingredient cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject tosignificant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, or the Credit Facility. See thesection titled “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facility” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Based on the average interest rate on the instruments under the Credit Facility during the fiscal year endedDecember 27, 2020, and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate would have amaterial effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2020.
Our interest-earning instruments also carry a degree of interest rate risk. As of December 27, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of 29.5 million andinvestments in available for sale securities of $68.4 million
We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes  and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate riskexposure.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our net revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. We purchasecertain equipment from foreign countries, and the cost related to this equipment is denominated in the currency of the applicable country. Additionally, to theextent our sourcing strategy changes or we commence generating revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreigncurrency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S.dollar to other currencies would not have had a material effect on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2020.

December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three ‑ year period ended December 27,
2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performingprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures thatrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financialstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overallpresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 VITAL FARMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Vital Farms, Inc. (“Vital Farms” or “the Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on June 6, 2013 and is headquartered in Austin, Texas. Vital Farmspackages, markets and distributes pasture-raised shell eggs, pasture-raised butter and other products. These products are sold under the trade names Vital Farms,Alfresco Farms, Lucky Ladies and RedHill Farms, primarily to retail foodservice channels in the United States.
Vital Farms Missouri, LLC, Backyard Eggs, LLC, Barn Door Farms, LLC and Sagebrush Foodservice, LLC are all wholly owned subsidiaries of VitalFarms. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the audited consolidated financial statements.
Fiscal Year: The Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December and contains either 52 or 53 weeks. Therefore, the financial results of certain53-week years will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week years. The years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019, and December30, 2018 all contain operating results for 52 weeks.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented business continuity plans designed to addressand mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business. The Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic willhave a material impact on the timelines for the Company’s product development and expansion efforts. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemicimpacts the Company’s business, product development and expansion efforts, corporate development objectives and the value of and market for the Company’scommon stock will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration ofthe pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States, and the effectiveness of actions takenglobally to contain and treat the disease, including the roll-out of vaccines. The global economic slowdown, the overall disruption of global supply chains anddistribution systems and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financialcondition, results of operations and growth prospects.
 Forward Stock Split: In July 2020, the board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a 2.46-for-1 forward stock split of theCompany’s outstanding common stock and preferred stock, which was effected on July 22, 2020. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares as a result of theforward stock split received a cash payment in lieu of receiving fractional shares. All common stock, preferred stock, and per share information has beenretroactively adjusted to give effect to this forward stock split for all periods presented. Shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock options and otherequity instruments were proportionately increased and the respective per share value and exercise prices, if applicable, were proportionately decreased inaccordance with the terms of the agreements governing such securities. There were no changes in the par values of the Company’s common stock and preferredstock as a result of the forward stock split.
 Initial Public Offering: In August 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 10,699,573 shares of common stock at an offeringprice of $22.00 per share.  The Company offered 5,040,323 shares of common stock and the selling stockholders offered an additional 5,659,250 shares ofcommon stock, including the underwriter’s option to purchase up to an additional 1,395,596 shares of common stock from the selling stockholders. The Companyreceived gross proceeds of approximately $110,887 before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering related transaction costs; the Company didnot receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.  Upon the closing of the IPO in August 2020, all of the then-outstanding shares ofpreferred stock automatically converted into 8,192,876 shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, there were no sharesof preferred stock outstanding. The consolidated financial statements as of December 27, 2020, including share and per share amounts, include the effects of theIPO.
Secondary Public Offering: In November 2020, the Company completed a secondary public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock from sellingstockholders in which no proceeds from the sale of shares were received by the Company and the Company incurred $0.5 million of expenses.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affectthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts ofrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates principally include revenue recognition, determination of useful lives for property andequipment, trade spend accruals, goodwill, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, valuation of common stock prior to IPO, stock optionvaluations, accrual liabilities and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company does not currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material impact on the timelines for the Company’s product development andexpansion efforts and the Company’s corporate development objectives. However, future COVID-19 developments are highly uncertain and unpredictable at this
time; therefore, our estimates and assumptions about future events cannot be determined with certainty and require the use of management’s judgment. As of thedate of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance related to the ongoing COVID-19pandemic that would require the Company to update its estimates, assumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Theseestimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as theybecome known. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Deferred Offering Costs: The Company capitalized certain legal, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly related to the Company’s in-
process equity financings until such financings were completed.  Upon closing the IPO in August 2020, all deferred offering costs were reclassified from prepaidand other current assets and recorded against the IPO proceeds reducing additional paid-in capital.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit riskconsist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains deposits with large financial institutions that the Companybelieves are of high credit quality. At times the Company’s cash and cash equivalents balances with individual banking institutions are in excess of federallyinsured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash and cash equivalents balances.
As of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the Company had customers that individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s accountsreceivable, net. During fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company also had customers that individually exceeded 10% or more of the Company’s net revenue.Significant customer information is presented below as follows:

Customer D  13%   14%   14%   15%   *
 
 
*Revenue and/or accounts receivable was less than 10%.
 
The decrease in net revenue for Customer A for fiscal 2020 is due a shift in our distribution channels to Customer B.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or lessat the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash deposits are all in financial institutions in the United States. As of December 27, 2020, cash and cashequivalents consisted of cash on deposit with balances denominated in U.S. dollars and investments in money market funds.  Investment Securities: The Company accounts for its investment securities in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and EquitySecurities. The Company considers all of its debt securities for which there is a determinable fair market value, and there are no restrictions on the Company'sability to sell within the next 12 months as available-for-sale. We have classified these securities as current, because the amounts invested are available for currentoperations. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Variable Interest Entity: The Company consolidates all entities where a controlling financial interest exists. The Company has considered its relationshipswith a certain entity to determine whether the Company has a variable interest in that entity, and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of therelationship. GAAP requires variable interest entities (“VIEs”) to be consolidated if an entity’s interest in the VIE is a controlling financial interest. Under thevariable model, a controlling financial interest is determined based on which entity, if any, has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that mostsignificantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligations to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right toreceive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
Management performs ongoing reassessments of whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Company’s involvement with a VIE willcause the consolidation conclusion to change. The consolidation status of a VIE may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status areapplied prospectively in accordance with GAAP.
Segment Information: The Company operates and manages its business as one reportable and operating segment. The Company’s chief executiveofficer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of evaluating financial performance andallocating resources. All of the Company’s long-lived assets and customers are located in the United States.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined below:
 
 •  Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
 •  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices forsimilar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated byobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
 
 •  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value ofthe assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques. 
The carrying amounts of the Company’s long-term debt approximate the fair value based on consideration of current borrowing rates available to theCompany (Level 2 input). The carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair valuesdue to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes anallowance for doubtful accounts as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings. Losses are charged against theallowance when management believes the receivable is no longer collectible. These losses have been immaterial to date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are creditedto the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on the credit risk of specific customers, pastcollection history, and management’s evaluation of accounts receivable. The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible tosignificant revision as more information becomes available. As of December 27, 2020 and December 29, 2019 the Company recorded an allowance for doubtfulaccounts of $196 and $304 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Inventory includes eggs,butter, packaging, feed, laying hens, pullets, merchandise and equipment parts. A reduction in the carrying value of an inventory item from cost to net realizablevalue is recorded in cost of goods sold with the offset to inventory. Any inventory that does not meet the quality control standards of the Company is separated anda reserve is recorded for the cost.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciationand amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The general range of useful lives of other property, plant andequipment is as follows:
    
   Estimated Useful Life
Land   N/ABuilding and improvements   39 yearsVehicles   5 yearsMachinery and equipment   2 to 7 yearsFurniture and fixtures   5 yearsLeasehold improvements   Lesser of lease term or 5 years
69

--- PAGE 73 ---
 
When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets disposed of are removed from the accounts, withany resulting gain or loss recorded in income from operations in the consolidated statements of operations. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed asincurred.
Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a businesscombination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes incircumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s goodwill impairment test is performed at the enterprise level given the sole reporting unit.
 The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances existed that would lead the Company to conclude that it ismore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fairvalue of the reporting unit is below the carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill assessment is required. In the quantitative evaluation, the fair value of thereporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, then the carrying value is deemed to berecoverable and no further action is required. If the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value, goodwill is considered impaired for the amount by which thecarrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value and a charge is reported as impairment of goodwill in the consolidated statements of operations. To date,the Company has not recorded any impairment charges associated with its goodwill.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events andcircumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventualdisposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount bywhich the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results,trends and prospects and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company did not recognize an impairment loss duringthe years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019, and December 30, 2018.
Contingent Consideration: In connection with the Company’s acquisition of certain assets of Heartland Eggs, LLC in 2014, the Company wasrequired to make royalty payments to prior owners of certain assets of Heartland Eggs. The royalty payments are contingent on the Company’s future purchase ofeggs from supplier contracts that were acquired in the certain assets of Heartland Eggs acquisition. The royalty payments are deemed to be contingent because thefuture egg purchases are not guaranteed, and the timing and amount of any such purchases are unknown. The fair value of the contingent consideration wasdetermined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs included projected financial information, market volatility, risk-adjusted discount rates and timing of contractual payments. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability isremeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements ofoperations.
Noncontrolling Interest: The Company recognizes noncontrolling interest related to VIEs, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as equityin the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity’s equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests isincluded in consolidated net income on the face of the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the parent entity’s ownership interest in a subsidiary thatdo not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, when a subsidiary isdeconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary will be initially measured at fair value and the difference between thecarrying value and fair value of the retained interest will be recorded as a gain or loss. Affiliate equity interests where the Company has certain rights to demandsettlement are presented at their current redemption values, as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet. Because these transactionstake place between entities under common control, any gains or losses attributable to these transactions are required to be included within additional paid-in-capitalon the consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities forthe expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In estimating future tax consequences, theCompany considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. A valuation allowance is recorded, if necessary, to reduce netdeferred tax assets to their realizable values if management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.
The Company follows the provisions of the authoritative guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) on accounting foruncertainty in income taxes. These provisions provide a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertainincome tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under these provisions, a company can recognize the benefit of an income taxposition only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of thetax position. Otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. Assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the sustainability of the positionand is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As of each balance sheet date,unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed. Additionally, the Company must accrue interest and related penalties, if applicable, on all tax exposures forwhich reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.
70

--- PAGE 74 ---
 
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of December 27,2020 and December 29, 2019 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to Vital Farms, Inc. Common Stockholders: The Company applies the two-class method to computebasic and diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders when shares meet the definition of participating securities. Thetwo-class method determines net income per share for each class of the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock according to dividends declared oraccumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to beallocated between the Company’s common stock and Preferred Stock based upon their respective rights to share in the earnings as if all income for the period hadbeen distributed. During periods of loss, there is no allocation required under the two-class method since the Preferred Stock does not have a contractual obligationto share in the Company’s losses.
Basic net income per share attributable to the Company’s stockholders is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of sharesoutstanding during the period without consideration of potentially dilutive common stock. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that couldoccur if securities or other contracts to issue shares of the Company’s common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance ofcommon stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company unless inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. For periods in which the Company reportsnet losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to the Company’s common stockholders is the same as basic net loss, because potentially dilutivecommon shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Revenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of products, including pasture-raised eggs and butter, to its customers,which include natural channel retailers, mainstream channel retailers and foodservice partners. The Company sells its products to customers on a purchase-orderbasis.
Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and the related performance obligation is satisfied, which typicallyoccurs upon delivery of the product to the customer, for an amount that reflects the net consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for deliveringthe product. We offer sales incentives through various programs to customers and allow deductions from our customers, which may include credits or discounts tocustomers in the event that products do not conform to customer specifications or expire at a customer’s site. The cost associated with promotions and chargebacksis estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue and is recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cashexpenditure. The recognition of this cost therefore requires management judgement regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed. Differencesbetween estimated cost and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.
Treasury Stock: The Company records treasury stock activities under the cost method whereby the cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasurystock. The Company’s accounting policy upon the formal retirement of treasury stock is to deduct the par value from the Company’s common stock and to reflectany excess of cost over par value as a reduction to additional paid-in capital (to the extent created by previous issuances of the shares).
Shipping and Distribution: The Company’s shipping and distribution costs include costs incurred with third-party carriers to transport products tocustomers and salaries and overhead costs related to activities to prepare the Company’s products for shipment. Shipping and distribution costs were $14,904,$10,001, and $8,615 during the years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. Freight-in costs are included withinCost of Goods Sold and were $5,126, $3,012, and $2,976 during the years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company measures all stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date ofthe grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certainsubjective assumptions, including the fair market value of the Company’s common stock, expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of the option, and the Company’s expected dividend yield.
Effective December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements toNonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”), which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment awards tononemployees. As a result, stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees are accounted for in the same manner as awards granted to employeesand directors as described above. The impact of adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
71

--- PAGE 75 ---
 
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the Company recognized compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees over the shorter of the vesting period or the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed. At theend of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is re-measured using the then-current fair value of theCompany’s common stock and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the awardrecipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.
Advertising and Promotion Expenses: Advertising and promotion expenses consist primarily of production costs and the costs to communicate theadvertisements to promote and market the Company’s products.  Production costs such as idea development, artwork, audio and video crews and other up-frontdevelopment costs are expensed the first time the associated advertising campaign is launched or aired.  The costs to communicate the advertisements such asairtime and distribution costs are expensed as incurred.  During the years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019, and December 30, 2018, the Companyincurred advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $9,815, $10,320, and $4,613, respectively.
 Emerging Growth Company Status: The Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012(“JOBS Act). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised financial accounting standards until such time as thosestandards apply to private companies. The Company elected to use the extended transition period for complying with the adoption of new or revised accountingstandards, and, as a result of this election, the Company’s financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effectivedates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): DisclosureFramework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair valuemeasurements. The standard is effective for all entities for years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption ispermitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on December 30, 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’sconsolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on FinancialReporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and othertransactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. Theamendments are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 on March 12, 2020 and theadoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20, ASU 2019-01,ASU 2019-10, ASU 2020-02, and ASU 2020-05 (collectively, “Topic 842”). The guidance in Topic 842 supersedes the leasing guidance in Topic 840, Leases.Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months.Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of operations.An entity may adopt the guidance either (1) retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative-effect adjustmentrecognized at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or (2) retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption through a cumulative-effect adjustment. The Company expects to adopt Topic 842 retrospectively at the beginning of the period of adoption, December 27, 2021, through a cumulative-effect adjustment, and will not apply the new standard to comparative periods presented. The new standard provides a number of practical expedients. Uponadoption, the Company expects to elect all of the practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of Topic842 on its consolidated financial statements. It is anticipated that the primary impact of the adoption of Topic 842 will be the recording of a right-of-use asset andlease liability of similar amount on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on FinancialInstruments (“ASU 2016-13”) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU2019-11, ASU 2020-02, and ASU 2020-03 (collectively, “Topic 326”), to introduce a new impairment model for recognizing credit losses on financial instrumentsbased on an estimate of current expected credit losses. Topic 326 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected tobe collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, andreasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information andestimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. For non-public companies, Topic 326 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2022,including interim periods within those years. The Company expects to adopt Topic 326 on December 26, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ofits pending adoption of Topic 326 on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”),which intends to simplify the guidance by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and clarifying or amending existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 iseffective for years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company expects to adopt ASU2019-12 on December 26, 2022. Although the Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2019-12, the Company does not expect it tohave a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

A valuation allowance is required to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. A full review of all positive and negativeevidence needs to be considered, including the Company’s current and past performance, the market environments in which the Company operates, the utilizationof past tax credits, the length of carry back and carry forward periods and tax planning strategies that might be implemented. Management considered thescheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The net change in the total valuation allowance for theyear ended December 27, 2020 was a decrease of approximately $138.
The activity in the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018was as follows:

Supplier Contracts: The Company purchases its egg inventories under long-term supply contracts with farms. Purchase commitments contained in thesearrangements are variable dependent upon the quantity of eggs produced by the farms. Accordingly, there are no estimable future purchase commitmentsassociated with these supplier contracts. In addition, substantially all the Company’s long-term supply contracts with farms contain components that meet thedefinition of embedded leases within the scope of Topic 840, Leases. These arrangements convey to the Company the right to control implicitly identified property,plant and equipment as it takes substantially all the utility generated by these assets over the term of the arrangements at a variable price. As total purchasecommitments contained in these arrangements are variable, the amounts attributable to the lease components are contingent rentals; there are no minimum leasepayments associated with these long-term supply contracts. As the classification and timing of recognition of costs attributable to the eggs and embedded cost ofthe lease rentals are identical, the Company does not allocate the total purchase cost of eggs between the cost of the eggs and the embedded cost of the lease rentalsor distinguish between them in its accounting records. The Company records the total purchase costs of eggs, which includes costs associated with the eggs and thecorresponding costs of embedded lease rentals from the same arrangement, into inventory. These costs are expensed to cost of goods sold when the associated eggsare sold to customers. During the years ended December 27, 2020, December 29, 2019, and December 30, 2018, the Company recognized total costs associatedwith its long-term supply contracts with farms of $84,537, $54,380, and $41,728, respectively.
Indemnification Agreements: In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors,lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or fromintellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its boardof directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason oftheir status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under theseindemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. As of December 27, 2020, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of suchindemnifications.
Litigation: The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies which are in the scope of ordinary and routine litigation incidental to its business,including those related to regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee-related matters and taxes, among others. When the Company becomes aware of aclaim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. The liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs incurred to date and future legal costs tothe point in the legal matter where the Company believes a conclusion to the matter will be reached. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot bereasonably estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible.
In January 2019, Ovabrite Inc. (“Ovabrite”) settled claims made pursuant to a lawsuit in which Ovabrite was the defendant and a countersuit in whichOvabrite was the plaintiff and recorded a related gain of $1,200, which is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
In 2019, we engaged new auditors as our independent accountants to audit our financial statements. Our board of directors approved the change ofaccountants to KPMG LLP, and we dismissed RSM US LLP on August 19, 2019.
The independent auditor’s report on our consolidated financial statements prepared by RSM US LLP under auditing standards generally accepted in theUnited States of America for the 2018 fiscal year did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty,audit scope, or accounting principles. There were (i) no disagreements with RSM US LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statementdisclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of RSM US LLP, would have caused RSM US LLP to makereference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report and (ii) no reportable events of the type listed in paragraphs (A) through (D) ofItem 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K issued by the SEC, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year and the subsequent periodthrough the replacement of RSM US LLP with KPMG LLP.
Neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf consulted with KPMG LLP at any time prior to their retention by us as our independent registered publicaccounting firm regarding any of the matters described in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or Item 304(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation S-K.
We have provided RSM US LLP with a copy of the disclosures set forth under the heading “Changes in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”included in this Annual Report and have requested that RSM US LLP furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not RSM US LLP agrees withstatements related to them made by us under the heading “Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure” in thisAnnual Report. A copy of that letter is filed as Exhibit 16.1 hereto.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, orthe Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded,processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management,including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that anycontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and managementnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures as of December 27, 2020. Based upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, ourdisclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Exhibit 4.3DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANTS’ SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF1934
The following description summarizes selected information regarding our capital stock, as well as relevant provisions of: (i) our amended and restated certificateof incorporation; (ii) our amended and restated bylaws; and (iii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL. The following summary isqualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws,copies of which have been filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is attached, and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
General
Our authorized capital stock consists of 320,000,000 shares, all with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which 310,000,000 shares are designated ascommon stock and 10,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.
Common Stock
Voting Rights
Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The affirmative vote of holdersof at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock, voting as a single class, will be required to amend certain provisionsof our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including provisions relating to amending our amended and restated bylaws, the classified board, the sizeof our board, removal of directors, director liability, vacancies on our board, special meetings, stockholder notices, actions by written consent, exclusivejurisdiction and our public benefit corporation purpose.
Economic Rights
Dividends and Distributions. Subject to preferences that may apply to any outstanding preferred stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receiveratably any dividends that our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for that purpose on a non-cumulative basis.
Liquidation Rights. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assetsremaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred stock.
No Preemptive or Similar Rights
Holders of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable toour common stock. The rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of theholders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future.Preferred Stock
Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation currently in effect, our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, fixthe rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and authorize their issuance.These rights, preferences and privileges could include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and thenumber of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, any or all of which may be greater than the rights of our common stock. Any issuance ofour preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock, and the likelihood that such holders would receive dividend paymentsand payments on liquidation. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying,
244299970 v3
 
 

--- PAGE 96 ---
deferring or preventing a change of control or other corporate action. No shares of preferred stock are outstanding. We have no present plan to issue any shares ofpreferred stock.
Registration Rights
Stockholder Registration Rights
We are party to a stockholders agreement that provides that certain holders of certain shares of our common stock have registration rights, as set forthbelow. This stockholders agreement was entered into as of July 6, 2020. The registration of shares of our common stock by the exercise of registration rightsdescribed below would enable the holders to sell these shares without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) when theapplicable registration statement is declared effective. We will pay the registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, of the sharesregistered by the demand, piggyback and Form S-3 registrations described below.
Demand Registration Rights
Certain holders of certain shares of our common stock (the “registrable securities”) are entitled to demand registration rights. Such holders are entitled, onnot more than one occasion, provided that the holders of at least 10% of the registrable securities as are then outstanding make such request, to request that weregister all or a portion of their registrable securities. Such request for registration must cover share of our common stock with an anticipated aggregate offeringprice, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of at least $15 million.
Piggyback Registration Rights
Certain holders of registrable securities issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested and unvested stock options are entitled to include their shares ofregistrable securities in an offering. In the event that we propose to register any of our securities under the Securities Act, either for our own account or for theaccount of other security holders, the holders of these shares will be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights allowing such holders to include their shares insuch registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations. As a result, whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act,subject to certain exceptions, the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right to include their shares in the registration, subjectto limitations that the underwriters may impose on the number of shares included in the offering.
Form S-3 Registration Rights
Certain holders of shares of common stock are entitled to certain Form S-3 registration rights. If we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, these holders have the right, upon written request from holders of at least 10% of such shares as are then outstanding, to have such shares registered by us if theanticipated aggregate offering price of such shares, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least $5 million, subject to exceptions set forth in thestockholders agreement.
Anti-Takeover Provisions
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:
 • permit our board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they maydesignate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control;
 • provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;
 • provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors;
 • provide that, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, directors may only be removed for cause, which removal maybe effected, subject to any limitation imposed by law, by the
244299970 v3
 
 

--- PAGE 97 ---
 holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election ofdirectors;
 • provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of amajority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;
 • require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not betaken by written consent or electronic transmission;
 • provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at ameeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’snotice;
 • provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or byour board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and
 • do not provide for cumulative voting rights, therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in anyelection of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose.
The amendment of any of these provisions would require approval by the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of our then-outstandingcommon stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
The combination of these provisions makes it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another party toobtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Because our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these provisions couldalso make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management. In addition, the authorization of undesignated preferredstock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt tochange our control.
These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and its policies and todiscourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to reduce our vulnerability to hostile takeovers and todiscourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers forour shares and may have the effect of delaying changes in our control or management. As a consequence, these provisions may also inhibit fluctuations in themarket price of our stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. We believe that the benefits of these provisions, including increasedprotection of our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure our company, outweigh thedisadvantages of discouraging takeover proposals, because negotiation of takeover proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.
Public Benefit Corporation Status
We are a public benefit corporation under Section 362 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate ofincorporation, we may not, without the approval of the holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding stock, amend our certificate of incorporation todelete or amend a provision relating to our public benefit corporation status or our public benefit purpose (or effect a merger or consolidation involving stockconsideration with an entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit to ours).
Additionally, as a public benefit corporation, our board of directors is required by the Delaware General Corporation Law to manage or direct our businessand affairs in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of our stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by our conduct, and the specificpublic benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our stockholders may bring a derivative suit to enforcethis requirement only if they own (individually or collectively), at least 2% of our outstanding capital stock or shares having at least $2 million in market value(whichever is less).
244299970 v3
 
 

--- PAGE 98 ---
We believe that our public benefit corporation status will make it more difficult for another party to obtain control of us without maintaining our publicbenefit corporation status and purpose.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
At any time when we have a class of voting stock that is either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders,we will be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combinationwith any interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.
Choice of Forum
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court ofChancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lacksubject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for actions or proceedings brought under Delawarestatutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (3) any actionasserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law; (4) any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation orour amended and restated bylaws; (5) any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State ofDelaware; or (6) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be theexclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.

Re: Oﬀer of Employment 
Dear Bo, 
It is my great pleasure to extend you an oﬀer of employment with Vital Farms, Inc. (the “Company”) at its Aus n, Texas loca on, beginning on July
24, 2020. Our success has been built on providing the highest quality, ethically produced food, full transparency about our farms and standards,
top-shelf service to our customers and care for our crew. We feel your experience, skill set, passion and energy are a fantas c ﬁt. We have a great
thing going and want you to help us to the next level and beyond. 
Your ini al posi on will be Execu ve Vice President, Finance, repor ng into the Chief Execu ve Oﬃcer and performing such du es as are normally
associated with these posi ons and such du es as are assigned to you from  me to  me. You will work remotely from your residence in San
Antonio un l such  me as mutually agreed to by you and the Company. This is a full- me posi on. As an exempt salaried employee, you will
devote substan ally all of your business  me and a en on to the business of the Company and will not be eligible for over me compensa on.
The Company an cipates that eﬀec ve January 1, 2021, you will assume the posi on of Chief Financial Oﬃcer. 
Your ini al base salary will be at the rate of $12,307.69 bi-weekly, which equates to $320,000 on an annualized basis, payable in accordance with
the Company’s standard payroll prac ces and subject to applicable deduc ons and withholdings. 
You will also be eligible to par cipate in the 401(k) plan maintained by the Company, which currently provides for a bi-weekly employer
contribu on equal to 3% of your earnings (subject to IRS employer contribu on limits), as well as a $40 per month cell-phone reimbursement and
$40 per month internet reimbursement (while working from home) in accordance with the Company’s policies on expense reimbursement. As a
leader in our company, you are eligible for  me oﬀ under our management  me oﬀ policy and will not be subject to the standard PTO limits. You
will be entrusted to manage your work and  me oﬀ in accordance with such policy and the business and opera onal needs of the Company. 
Addi onally, you will be eligible to earn a discre onary annual bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) at an annual target amount of 60% of your base salary.
Whether any Annual Bonus is awarded will be based upon the Company's assessment of your performance and the Company’s a ainment of goals
as set by the Board of Directors in its sole discre on. Following the close of each ﬁscal year, the Company will determine in its
 

--- PAGE 100 ---
 
sole discre on whether it will award you an Annual Bonus and the amount of any such Annual Bonus. No amount of the Annual Bonus is
guaranteed, and in addi on to the other condi ons for being awarded such compensa on, you must be an employee in good standing on the
Annual Bonus payment date to be eligible to earn and receive an Annual Bonus. The Annual Bonus, if any, will be paid on an annual basis, less
applicable payroll deduc ons and withholdings, as soon as prac cable a er the end of the calendar year for which it was earned, but in no event
will it be paid later than March 15 of the year following the ﬁscal year for which it was earned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for ﬁscal year 2020,
provided you remain employed in good standing through the end of the year, you will be en tled to an Annual Bonus, in an amount as determined
by the Board of Directors based on goals set by the Board of Directors, provided such amount shall be no less than 90% and no more than 100% of
60% of your base salary, prorated for the period of  me you were employed during 2020. With the excep on of ﬁscal year 2020, no par al or
prorated bonuses will be provided. 
Subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors (or authorized commi ee), you will be provided with an Op on to purchase 162,511
shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to any stock splits or other capitaliza on adjustments (the “Op on”). The Op on will be granted
con ngent and eﬀec ve upon the execu on of the underwri ng agreement pursuant to which the Company’s common stock is priced in an
underwri en registered ini al public oﬀering (the “IPO”), provided you have commenced employment as of such date, with an exercise price per
share equal to the ini al price per share that the Company’s common stock is ﬁrst sold to the public in connec on with the IPO. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the IPO does not occur on or before September 30, 2020, the Op on will be granted to you as soon as the Company’s Board of
Directors determines prac cable, with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the  me of
such grant based on receipt of an independent valua on of the Company’s common stock. In any event, the Op on will vest in ﬁve equal annual
installments, measured from your start date with the Company, and subject to your con nued service with the Company. The Op on will be
subject to the terms and condi ons applicable to op ons granted under the Company’s equity incen ve plan then in eﬀect and applicable op on
agreement. 
Your employment is subject to the Company’s personnel policies and procedures as they may be interpreted, adopted, revised or deleted from
 me to  me in the Company’s sole discre on. You will be eligible to par cipate on the same basis as similarly situated employees in the
Company’s beneﬁt plans in eﬀect from  me to  me during your employment. All ma ers of eligibility for coverage or beneﬁts under any beneﬁt
plan shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of such plan. The Company reserves the right to change, alter, or terminate any beneﬁt
plan in its sole discre on. An overview of our current beneﬁt plans will be provided.

Re:  Oﬀer of Employment
Dear Pete,
It is my great pleasure to extend you an oﬀer of employment with Vital Farms, Inc. (the “Company”) at its Aus n, Texas loca on, beginning on
October 26, 2020 (the “Start Date”). Our success has been built on providing the highest quality, ethically produced food, full transparency about
our farms and standards, top-shelf service to our customers and care for our crew. We feel your experience, skill set, passion and energy are a
fantas c ﬁt. We have a great thing going and want you to help us to the next level and beyond. Subject to your execu on of this le er (the “Oﬀer
Le er”), this Oﬀer Le er amends, restates and supersedes in its en rety your prior oﬀer le er with the Company dated October 5, 2020 (the
“Prior Agreement”).
Your posi on will be Chief Sales Oﬃcer, repor ng into the Chief Execu ve Oﬃcer and performing such du es as are normally associated with that
posi on and such du es as are assigned to you from  me to  me. You will work remotely from your residence in Dallas un l such  me as mutually
agreed to by you and the Company. This is a full- me posi on.  As an exempt salaried employee, you will devote substan ally all of your business
 me and a en on to the business of the Company and will not be eligible for over me compensa on.
Your ini al base salary will be at the rate of $12,307.69 bi-weekly, which equates to $320,000 on an annualized basis, payable in accordance with
the Company’s standard payroll prac ces and subject to applicable deduc ons and withholdings.  
If you execute this Oﬀer le er and commence employment in accordance with this Oﬀer Le er, you will be advanced a one- me sign-on bonus of
$50,000, subject to applicable deduc ons and withholdings, which will be earned in full on the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Start Date
(the “Sign-On Bonus”). The Sign-On Bonus will be payable in a lump sum payment on the Company’s ﬁrst regular payroll date following your Start
Date, provided that you remain employed by the Company on such date. If you resign from employment with the Company before the twelve (12)-
month anniversary of the Start Date, you will be obligated to, and hereby agree to, repay a prorated por on of the net, a er-tax amount of the
Sign-On Bonus paid out to you on or before the termina on date, based on the number of days you were employed by the Company prior to your
resigna on.  You agree that if you are obligated to repay all or a por on of the Sign-On Bonus, the Company may deduct, in accordance with
applicable law, any such amount from any payments the Company owes you, including but not limited
235402853 v1

--- PAGE 103 ---
 
to any regular payroll amount and any expense payments.  You further agree to pay to the Company, within thirty (30) days of your eﬀec ve
termina on date, any remaining unpaid balance of the unearned Sign-On Bonus not covered by such deduc ons.
You will also be eligible to par cipate in the 401(k) plan maintained by the Company, which currently provides for a bi-weekly employer
contribu on equal to 3% of your earnings (subject to IRS employer contribu on limits), as well as a $40 per month cell-phone reimbursement and
$40 per month internet reimbursement (while working from home) in accordance with the Company’s policies on expense reimbursement. As a
leader in our company, you are eligible for  me oﬀ under our management  me oﬀ policy and will not be subject to the standard PTO limits.  You
will be entrusted to manage your work and  me oﬀ in accordance with such policy and the business and opera onal needs of the Company.
The Company will also provide you with a recurring monthly payment of $650, less applicable deduc ons and withholdings, to cover expenses
related to your personal automobile which shall be used for work-related local travel (the “Monthly Automobile Payment”).  The Monthly
Automobile Payment will be paid on the Company’s ﬁrst regularly scheduled payroll date of each month; provided, however, that you must be an
employee in good standing on the applicable payment date to be eligible to receive the Monthly Automobile Payment for that month.  The
Monthly Automobile Payment may be changed, modiﬁed or terminated at any  me by the Company in its sole discre on.
Addi onally, you will be eligible to earn a discre onary annual bonus (the “Annual Bonus”) at an annual target amount of 60% of your base salary.
Whether any Annual Bonus is awarded will be based upon the Company's assessment of your performance and the Company’s a ainment of goals
as set by the Board of Directors in its sole discre on. Following the close of each ﬁscal year, the Company will determine in its sole discre on
whether it will award you an Annual Bonus and the amount of any such Annual Bonus. No amount of the Annual Bonus is guaranteed, and in
addi on to the other condi ons for being awarded such compensa on, you must be an employee in good standing on the Annual Bonus payment
date to be eligible to earn and receive an Annual Bonus. The Annual Bonus, if any, will be paid on an annual basis, less applicable payroll
deduc ons and withholdings, as soon as prac cable a er the end of the calendar year for which it was earned, but in no event will it be paid later
than March 15 of the year following the ﬁscal year for which it was earned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for ﬁscal year 2020, provided you
remain employed in good standing through the end of the year, you will be en tled to an Annual Bonus, in an amount as determined by the Board
of Directors based on goals set by the Board of Directors, provided such amount shall be no less than 130% and no more than 130% of 60% of your
base salary, for the full calendar year 2020. With the excep on of ﬁscal year 2020, no par al or prorated bonuses will be provided.
Subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors (or authorized commi ee), you will be provided with an op on to purchase 91,972
shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to any stock splits or other capitaliza on adjustments (the “Op on”), with an exercise price per
share equal to the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  The Op on will vest in four equal annual
installments, measured from your start date with the Company, and subject to your con nued service with the Company. The Op on will be
subject to the terms and condi ons applicable to op ons granted under the Company’s equity incen ve plan then in eﬀect and applicable op on
agreement.
Your employment is subject to the Company’s personnel policies and procedures as they may be interpreted, adopted, revised or deleted from
 me to  me in the Company’s sole discre on. You will be eligible to par cipate on the same basis as similarly situated employees in the
Company’s beneﬁt plans
235402853 v1

--- PAGE 104 ---
 
in eﬀect from  me to  me during your employment. All ma ers of eligibility for coverage or beneﬁts under any beneﬁt plan shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of such plan. The Company reserves the right to change, alter, or terminate any beneﬁt plan in its sole discre on.
An overview of our current beneﬁt plans will be provided.  
As set forth above, your employment with the Company will at all  mes be “at will” which means that either you or the Company may terminate
your employment at any  me for any reason, with or without advance no ce.
